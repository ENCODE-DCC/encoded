The probable locations of the specified histone modifications in the given cell types were
determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). 
Each experiment is associated with an input signal which represents the control condition where 
immunoprecipitation with non-specific immunoglobulin was performed in the same cell type. 


Methods
========

Cells were grown according to the approved ENCODE cell culture protocols. For details on the 
chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol used, see Euskirchen et al. (2007), Rozowsky et al. (2009) 
and Auerbach et al. (2009).

DNA recovered from the precipitated chromatin was sequenced on the Illumina sequencing platform 
and mapped to the genome using the Eland alignment program. ChIP-seq data was scored based on sequence 
reads (length ~30 bp) that align uniquely to the human genome. From the mapped tags, a signal map of 
ChIP DNA fragments (average fragment length ~200 bp) was constructed where the signal height was 
the number of overlapping fragments at each nucleotide position in the genome.

These data were generated by the labs of Michael Snyder at Stanford University and Sherman 
Weissman at Yale University.

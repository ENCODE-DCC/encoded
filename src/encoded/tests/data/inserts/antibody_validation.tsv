Lane 1: input nuclear lysate, Lane 2: material immunoprecipitated with ab5095, Lane 3: material immunoprecipitated using control IgG. Bands A and B were excised from the gel and subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry. IP followed by masspectrometry: Briefly, protein was immunoprecipitated from K562 whole cell lysates using ab5095, and the IP fraction was loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (NuPAGE Bis-Tris Gel) and separated with an Invitrogen NuPAGE electrophoresis system. The gel was silver-stained, gel fragments corresponding to the bands indicated were excised and destained using the SilverSNAP Stain for Mass Spectrometry (Pierce). Then proteins were trypsinized using the in-gel digestion method. Digested proteins were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific) by the nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS technique. Peptides were identified by the SEQUEST algorithm and filtered with a high confidence threshold (Protein false discovery rate < 1%, 2 peptides per protein minimum). We report 38 proteins identified in band A, although 11 of these are also present in a control immunoprecipitation and are thus likely to present due to non-specific association with the IP matrix. Of the specifically immunoprecipitated proteins, GRp20 is the most abundant (99 peptides). Based on these observations, this band is likely due to the presence of immunoprecipitated GRp20 and Sc-1002 meets the ENCODE standard for validation by this criterion.

They spotted synthetic peptides containing one of about 20 histone modifications on a blot, in two different concentrations. The blot was then allowed to react with the antibody, and the antigen-antibody complexes were visualized and quantified. In each case, the antibody showed strong specificity. This is far better than showing a single band on a Western blot, since all the modifications we examine are on histone H3, and they all will show the H3 band. The Western blot will not demonstrate specificity for a particular modification, whereas the dot blot does.   Our âvalidation pointâ for mouse is that there is nothing species-specific about the existing validations. Synthetic peptides were used on the blot, and the assay was for specific reaction with the antibody. The peptides on the blot were not species-specific because HUMAN AND MOUSE HISTONE H3 ARE IDENTICAL IN THE RELEVANT REGIONS.

Two different biological replicates of HeLa cells were used; one sample was ChIPseq profiles: 99% of the top 40% of targets identified with the HA antibody are in teh targets identified using the E2F1 antibody and 97.5% of the top 40% of targets identified using the E2F1 antibody are in the target identified using the HA antibody.

Two different TCF7L2 ChIP-seq datasets were prepared from HelaS3 cells either using the anti-TCF7L2 C9B9 antibody or the C48H11 antibody.

A) Western blot analysis: 25ug of nuclear extracts from HepG2, HelaS3 or MCF7 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting with 1:1,000 anti-TCF7L2 C9B9 antibody in 5% milk/TBST. Two predominant bands corresponding to known isoforms of TCF7L2 are detected. B) Immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis of TCF7L2. TCF7L2 was precipitated from 100ug HCT116 nuclear extracts using 2 ug of two different anti-TCF7L2 antibodies, C9B9 or C48H11 and 2ug control rabbit IgG was used as a control. The eluates of the immunoprecipitation reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted as in A). Both anti-TCF7L2 antibodies efficiently precipitated the two different TCF7L2 isoforms from these extracts.

Results & Figure legend: IP-western with sc-5916 anti-CTCF antibody in nuclear extract (NE) of K562 and whole cell lysate (WCL) of K562, GM12878, and HeLa cells.Protein marker (PM) labeled in kDa.A band of expected size for CTCF (~120 kDa) was detected, representing the strongest signal, except for heavy chain contamination.

Results:IDR results of ChIP comparison by IDR between two K562 biological replicates of ChIP with CTCF (sc-5916) and CTCF (AM 61312).All of the Np/Nt ratios are less than 2, indicating significant replication of binding sites when ChIP is perfomed with the two antibodies directed against CTCF.

Gel fragments corresponding to the bands indicated the western blot image in Validation 1 were excised and sent to the University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics Shared Facility. The samples were analyzed on an LTQ XL Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Peptides were identified using SEQUEST tandem mass spectra analysis, with probability based matching at p < 0.05. \u00c2\u00a0SEQUEST results were reported with the ProteinProphet protXML Viewer (TPP v4.4 JETSTREAM) and filtered for a minimum probability of 0.9. \u00c2\u00a0All protein hits that meet these criteria are reported, including common contaminants. \u00c2\u00a0The target protein, TCF4, was identified in both the 65 and 85 kDa bands.",

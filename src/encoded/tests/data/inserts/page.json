View data from this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=experiment&amp;month_released=September,%202014\">current release</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The new data are released under a rapid release policy by which primary data (e.g., fastq sequence files) are released immediately after validation to data formatting standards.

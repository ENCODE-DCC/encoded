It achieves this goal by connecting a comprehensive self-updating database of curated clinical-pathological patient data with integrated genomic analyses and research samples.</p>\n\n<p>Kidney Cancer Explorer (KCE) seamlessly integrates up-to-date clinical-pathological data with high-dimensional genomics and research samples into a unified database that supports powerful analytical tools for integrative studies. Data are extracted using automatic queries run monthly from multiple warehouses (EPIC, Co-PATH, Tumor Registry, Mosaic, and Cancer Gene Connect). Raw and patient level data are available through a password-protected system. Exome-seq or RNA-seq is available for over 500 specimens. Information can be linked to an extensive biobank including possibly the largest collection of live tumor samples and kidney cancer tumorgrafts. The database has been designed as a scalable engine to meet the complex and increasing demands of biomedical research. </p>\n\n<p>KCE is the result of a fruitful collaboration between the <a href=\"http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/departments/bioinformatics/\"> Department of Bioinformatics</a>  and the <a href=\"http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/kidney-cancer/\"> Kidney Cancer Program</a> at UT Southwestern.

You can also <a href=\"#search\">use the Search box</a> to search for keywords. Also of note is the &ldquo;Download&rdquo; button to the right which allows users to <a href=\"#download\">batch download files</a>. The <a href=\"#viz\">&ldquo;Visualize&rdquo; button</a> also appears to the right once facets have been selected to filter the number of results to 100 or fewer. The &quot;Add experiment to cart&quot; button is part of the Portal&#39;s cart feature, described in detail <a href=\"/help/cart/\">here</a>. More information about JSON format is available on the <a href=\"/help/rest-api/\">REST API page</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>These results can be filtered by selecting one or more values in a metadata category, also referred to as a &quot;facet,&quot; on the left hand side of the page. Multiple facet values, in the same or different categories, can be selected at any one time to generate more specific queries. To exclude a facet value, click the <i class=\"icon icon-minus-circle\" style=\"color:#FF0000\"> </i> exclusion icon which appears to the right of each facet value when the cursor is hovered above it.

With each selected facet, a parameter is added to your query based on the property and the desired value of that property. For example, in Figure 2, the selection of the H3K4me3 target adds <code>target.label=H3K4me3</code> to your URL:</p>\n\n<pre>\nhttps://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&amp;<strong>target.label=H3K4me3</strong></pre>\n\n<p>Users can use any valid property of an object as a parameter, beyond those listed as facets. Generally, a query will be in the following format:</p>\n\n<pre>\nhttps://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=<strong>Object_type</strong>&amp;<strong>property_1</strong>=<strong>value_1</strong>&amp;<strong>property_2</strong>=<strong>value_2</strong>&amp;...</pre>\n\n<p>Below are some useful tips for query building:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Wildcard (<code>*</code> or <code>%2A</code>) is accepted as a valid property value.</li>\n\t<li>Not equals (<code>!=</code> or <code>%21=</code>) can be used for negation.</li>\n\t<li>Multiple parameters are joined with an <code>&amp;</code>.</li>\n\t<li>To access a sub-property, the sub-property name can be joined to the property name with a <code>.</code>, as in <code>target.label</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Object types and their properties are fully documented in the <a href=\"/profiles/?\">object schemas</a>. It is also helpful to understand the ENCODE Portal&#39;s <a href=\"/help/data-organization\">data model</a>.</p>\n\n<p>An example of an advanced query utilizing the above query building features is the below search, which filters for experiments (<code>type=Experiment</code>) that are released (<code>status=released</code>), not a control (<code>target.label%21=Control</code>), and are part of the ENTEx collaboration (<code>internal_tags=ENTEx</code>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<pre>\nhttps://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&amp;status=released&amp;target.label%21=Control&amp;internal_tags=ENTEx\n</pre>\n\n<p>More information and interactive examples of query building can be found on <a href=\"https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/encodeproject/api/basic_search#/\">Swagger</a>.</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"search\" name=\"search\">Search by keyword</a></h3>\n\n<p>The website can be searched by entering a search term in the search box located in the upper right hand corner in the toolbar (see Figure 1), which appears on every page. This returns relevant results of any object type&nbsp;(such as Experiments, Antibodies, Publications, or others). Due to the number of objects stored on the Portal, only a subset of key properties, which are documented in the <a href=\"/profiles/?\">Schemas</a> for each object type, are searchable with this method.</p>\n\n<p>The search results can be narrowed by object type by selecting an item in the &quot;Data Type&quot;&nbsp;facet&nbsp;on the left hand side of the page, and then further filtered using the displayed facets&nbsp;(refer to the <a href=\"#browse\">&quot;Browse and filter data&quot;</a> section above).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Example search terms include a biosample (e.g.<a href=\"/search/?searchTerm=skin\">&quot;skin&quot;</a>), an assay name (e.g. <a href=\"/search/?searchTerm=ChIP-seq\">&quot;ChIP-seq&quot;</a>), or a protein target of an antibody (e.g. <a href=\"/search/?searchTerm=CTCF\">&quot;CTCF&quot;</a>).</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"region\" name=\"region\">Search by region</a></h3>\n\n<p>It is possible to search for experiments by region using <a href=\"/region-search/\">Region Search</a>, located in the &quot;Data&quot; drop down menu. It accepts coordinates and gene names among other forms of region identifiers and returns experiments for which the input region intersects regions specified in the peaks file.</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"exptpage\" name=\"exptpage\">Viewing experiment pages</a></h3>\n\n<p>After searching for experiments, clicking on a link to a specific experiment will bring you to the experiment summary page:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"fig fig-align-center\" style=\"width:90%\"><img src=\"/images/20ac7c1e-6800-4421-bda1-b492a5e62801/@@download/attachment/exptpage_gettingstarted_1909.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 4.

Towards the right, there is also a browser selector, which will allow you to choose between UCSC, Ensembl, or Juicebox genome browsers. Files must be in bigBed or bigWig file format to be visualized as a track hub, or hic format to be visualized using Juicebox. Click the &quot;Visualize&quot; button to open the external genome browser.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"fig fig-align-center fig-width-75\"><img src=\"/images/c183d4fe-f86b-4c8c-910b-7c92b626c0da/@@download/attachment/Visualize_1908_external.png\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 6. Use the Assembly and Browser selectors in the File details tab and then click Visualize to go to a new tab with applicable files from the experiment loaded as tracks in the genome browser.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The &quot;Visualize&quot; button also appears on Search and Matrix view pages (see Fig.&nbsp;1) once filtered to a maximum of 100 experiments, provided there are released experiments with visualizable files&nbsp;within that set, as shown in <a href=\"/?walkme=19-401327\" target=\"_blank\">this tutorial</a> (link opens in new tab). By clicking &quot;Visualize&quot; from a search page, you can open a genome browser view with track hubs for each experiment in the search results, allowing you to visualize data from multiple experiments simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p align=\"right\"><strong><a href=\"#use\">Back to top</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #BFBFBF\"><a id=\"download\" name=\"download\">Download files</a></h3>\n\n<p>Links to download individual files are available beside each file accession listed in the file section of each experiment page (see above in Fig. 4), as well as on each file&#39;s individual page. Files can be downloaded directly from the web page. Alternatively, the link can be copied to be downloaded using the command line, as in the below examples:</p>\n\n<p>Via the wget command:</p>\n\n<pre>\n &gt; wget https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF002CTW/@@download/ENCFF002CTW.bed.gz</pre>\n\n<p>Or via the curl command:</p>\n\n<pre>\n &gt; curl -O -L https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF002CTW/@@download/ENCFF002CTW.bed.gz</pre>\n\n<p>There are multiple options for downloading more than one file. While browsing through experiments (see &quot;<a href=\"#browse\">Browse and filter data</a>&quot;), a &quot;Download&quot; button appears near the top of the page (see Fig. 2), which brings up a batch download pop-up window with instructions on how to download the files of all experiments found with the current query. A tutorial going over <a href=\"?walkme=19-401304\" target=\"_blank\">batch download</a> is available (link opens in new tab.) The cart feature, described below, can also be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that if ENCODE data is used in your publication or talk, the accessions of the datasets used should be cited, along with the most recent ENCODE Consortium publication. Complete guidelines are available on the <a href=\"/help/citing-encode/\">Citing ENCODE page</a>.</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"cart\" name=\"cart\">Cart</a></h3>\n\n<p>The Portal has a cart function, which allows users to select and group together arbitrary experiments. Carts can be shared with colleagues; it is also possible to batch download all the files of the experiments placed in the cart. When viewing the cart, the file selectors located in the sidebar can be used to filter for only files meeting certain conditions, such as assembly used or file format, prior to performing a batch download.&nbsp;Detailed information on how to use the cart is located on the <a href=\"/help/cart/\">Cart page</a>, and Cart basics are demonstrated in <a href=\"/?walkme=19-402187\" target=\"_blank\">this tutorial</a> (link opens in new tab).</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"programmatic\" name=\"programmatic\">Programmatic access to the Portal</a></h3>\n\n<p>In addition to web-based browsing and searching, the ENCODE Portal can be accessed programmatically via the REST API. Instructions on how to browse and search for ENCODE data programmatically are provided in the <a href=\"/help/rest-api\">REST API help document</a>. In brief, all queries (see <a href=\"#query\">Query building</a>) that can be performed via the web can be used as programmatic queries. Programmatic access provides additional methods to download files by retrieving direct URLs of files from JSON data objects.</p>\n\n<p align=\"right\"><strong><a href=\"#use\">Back to top</a></strong></p>\n"

                "body": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Direct interaction with the KCE database is typically done through scripts you write and execute on your own Mac, PC or server. Your scripts interact with the database through an industry-standard, Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol-(HTTP)-based, Representational-state-transfer (RESTful) application programming interface (API). Data objects exchanged with the server conform to the standard JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. JSON is a defined data interchange format that is used web-wide. If you&rsquo;re familiar with JavaScript&rsquo;s object literal notation or Python&rsquo;s dictionary datatype, then JSON-formatted text will look familiar. You will almost certainly use libraries for your language of choice to handle the network connection and parse the objects returned (<a href=\"http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/\">requests</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html\">json</a> for Python, for example).</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>Quickstart examples</h2>\n\n<p>While getting objects from the database can often be done in just a few lines of code, here are some quick ways of testing your connection and exploring the KCE data objects without writing any code.</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>A JSON pretty-printer plugin for your web browser, such as JSONView (for <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en\">Chrome</a> or <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/jsonview/\">Firefox</a>) or json-lite&nbsp;(for <a href=\"https://github.com/rfletcher/safari-json-formatter/downloads\">Safari</a>)</li>\n\t<li>The <code>curl</code> command, which ships with Mac OSX and all major LINUX/UNIX implementations. If you don&#39;t have <code>curl</code>, an executable can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin\">here</a>. Make sure you get the SSL and SSH aware version. You will find <code>curl</code> useful later for debugging your scripts (it always works), so if you don&#39;t already have it, you&#39;ll want to get it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3><a id=\"json-in-browser\" name=\"json-in-browser\">KCE JSON in your browser</a></h3>\n\n<p>Look at example Patient KCEPT480NBU.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"fig-align-center fig-width-50\" src=\"/images/0f9eadae-95e7-49d9-b796-38925a995d0d/@@download/attachment/json.png\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 347px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>By clicking the JSON button, which looks like <code>{;}</code>, you should see the page viewed as JSON. Alternatively,&nbsp;you can manually add the following parameter to the URL: <code>/?format=json</code></p>\n\n<p><img class=\"fig-align-left fig-width-50\" src=\"/images/7aaac70e-de90-4546-ae7f-60be5e376512/@@download/attachment/json_browser_hires.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 375px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>By adding the <code>/?format=json</code> parameter, you&#39;ve instructed the KCE webserver to send you the raw contents of the database record for KCEPT480NBU, in JSON format. Rather than being rendered in your browser, you see the native JSON object as it is stored in the KCE database. This is a patient object, and you will see all the properties and their values for this object. You need a JSON pretty printer (see prerequisites above) in order to make sense of the JSON. Notice that many of the object&rsquo;s properties contain other (nested) objects.</p>\n\n<p>Notice also that the object has its own URL, and that the URL corresponds to the object&rsquo;s accession number. This always works to access KCE objects. <em>In fact, because accession numbers are unique, you can construct a URL from the accession number alone and the server will return your object.</em></p>\n\n<p>As you learn more about the KCE REST API, you&rsquo;ll see that when you retrieve objects (using the HTTP &ldquo;GET&rdquo; method) from the server, they always come back as JSON.</p>\n\n<h3>REST, JSON and curl in perspective</h3>\n\n<p>As you develop your scripts, curl can be a valuable testing tool. If you can get an object with a curl command, you should be able to get it with your script.</p>\n\n<p>The important thing to remember is that each ENCODE object is accessible via a simple URL containing an identifier (like an accession number) for that object. That&#39;s all curl does, that&#39;s all your browser does, and that&#39;s all your scripts will do. The resource you GET, using that URL, will be in JSON format. You will then use a library to parse the JSON and construct a native data structure (like a Python dictionary).</p>\n\n<h2>The KCE REST API</h2>\n\n<p>The KCE REST API uses GET to transport JSON-formatted information between the server and your scripts.</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>A library or module for your language of choice that supports HTTP. The <code>requests</code> library <a href=\"http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for Python is good, and will be used for examples in this documentation.</li>\n\t<li>A library or module for parsing JSON-structured text and building native data structures. The Python <code>json</code>&nbsp;library <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> is good.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3><a id=\"json-script\" name=\"json-script\">GET</a></h3>\n\n<p>The HTTP GET request&nbsp;is used to retrieve objects from the KCE server. GET will work without a username and password to fetch publicly-released KCE objects. Sending a GET request&nbsp;is accomplished here by using the <code>requests.get()</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>The important point is that the response object has been cast into a native Python dict datastructure. For example, documents is an array of document identifiers and so you can loop over that array.</p>\n\n</pre>\n\n<h3><a id=\"search-features\" name=\"search-features\">Summary of search features</a></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If you do not specify <code>frame=something</code>, you will get a subset of object properties as defined by the webapp. If what you need is in that subset (like accession, maybe), it&rsquo;s a relatively fast way of getting back a long list of objects.</li>\n\t<li>If you specify <code>frame=embedded</code> you will get all the object properties, with selected embedded objects expanded.</li>\n\t<li><code>frame=object</code> will always give you all of the properties, with embedded objects referred to by an identifier. So it&rsquo;s consistent, and it&rsquo;s faster. Which embedded objects are expanded by <code>frame=embedded</code> may change in the future as our requirements for search change. Also, the depth of expansion is chosen to support search and might change&nbsp;as well. So, for the most robust code you might choose to use <code>frame=object</code> and then GET only the embedded objects you need.</li>\n\t<li>You do not need to specify <code>frame=embedded</code> in order to search within embedded objects. For example, the query paramater <code>lab.state=CA</code> would work when searching with&nbsp;<code>frame=object</code></li>\n\t<li>All of the results from search can be visualized within the web app by opening the URL in your browser, omitting <code>format=json</code>. Not all objects have fancy rendered collections or pages, but you will always get back a clickable list.</li>\n\t<li><code>limit=all</code> is not strictly necessary but without it your result will contain only the first 25 hits (or all if &lt; 25 hits). We plan to implement a mechanism to return very large searches in batches, but for now <code>limit=all</code> can generate large result sets.</li>\n\t<li>Giving <code>searchTerm=somestring</code> will often return multiple object types. You can look into the <code>@type</code> property of each returned object for its data type.</li>\n\t<li>To make a search specifying that a property is NOT equal to a value (negation), use the <code>!=</code> operator (see example 9 above)</li>\n\t<li>The <code>*</code> character can be used as a wildcard, matching any value. This is useful when you would like to check the existence or non-existence of a property. Specifing <code>property=*</code> will return objects for which the property is both present and non-empty. It can be used with <code>!=</code> as well to search for objects where a property is missing or empty.</li>\n</ul>\n",

                "body": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>KCE uses several file formats to store, display, and disseminate data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"#fastq\">FASTQ</a>: a text-based format for storing nucleotide sequences (reads) and their quality scores. [<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a>]</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#bam\">BAM:</a> The Sequence Alignment/Mapping (SAM) format is a text-based format for storing read alignments against reference sequences and it is interconvertible with the binary BAM format. [<a href=\"#ref1\">2</a>]</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#vcf\">VCF:</a> The VCF format is a flexible and extendable format for variation data such as single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, copy number variants and structural variants.</li>\n</p>\n\n<h2><a id=\"fastq\" name=\"fastq\">FASTQ</a></h2>\n\n<h3>FASTQ file content</h3>\n\n<p>FASTQ files are submitted as they come off the sequencing instrument to allow for maximal decision making of downstream users. The files are accompanied by documentation detailing how the sequencing libraries were constructed to inform the end-user about how they might want to process the data, the strengths and limitations of the various options of data processing, and how these may apply according to the user&#39;s biological questions of interest.</p>\n\n<p>Biological replicates involve different biological samples, e.g., different tissue preparations for cell growth and expansion when cell lines are used. Biological replicates are contrasted with technical replicates, for which different sequencing libraries are prepared from the same sample, or different sequencing lanes for the same library. Reads from different replicates are stored in separate files and should include flow cell and lane ID. If multiple lanes are used for the same biological or technical replicate, they are stored in the same file (after a QC check to eliminate failed lanes), with information on flow cell and lane ID included. For experiments that produce paired-end reads, the two reads in each pair are stored in two separate files, with the reads in the same order in the two files.</p>\n\n<p>The reads in FASTQ files are unfiltered, i.e., barcodes, adapter sequences, and spike-ins remain in the files. For Illumina sequencing, the barcodes that are in the so-called third read position should not be present in the sequence.</p>\n\n<p>Reads are not &quot;clipped&quot; (no bases are removed). </p>\n\n<h3>FASTQ sequencing quality</h3>\n\n<p>FASTQ uses four lines for each sequence with the fourth line denoting the sequencing quality in each position. We report the Phred quality score from 0 to 93 using ASCII 33 to 126, i.e., Phred score plus 33. This is used by the newest versions of the Illumina pipeline, Sanger and SRA. The Phred score of a base[<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a>][<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a>] is defined as -10 log10 (<em>e</em>) where <em>e</em> is the estimated probability for a base to be erroneous.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format\">Introductory information on the FASTQ format</a></p>\n\n<h2><a id=\"bam\" name=\"bam\">BAM</a></h2>\n\n<h3>BAM file content</h3>\n\n<p>When sequence reads are mapped to reference sequences, the resulting alignments are stored in BAM files (SAMtools are used to convert between SAM and BAM files). Mapping algorithms (e.g., Bowtie, BWA, STAR, etc.) use many parameters, such as the version of a reference genome, the total number of mismatches allowed during mapping, the maximal number of times a read is allowed to map to the reference, etc. Furthermore, SAMtools may change the content while converting a SAM file to a BAM file. For example, the user may allow both unique-mapping and multiple-mapping reads during the mapping and then decide to retain only unique-mapping reads in the BAM file. Therefore we document the parameters used by the mapping algorithm and SAMtools in the header of the BAM files.</p>\n\n<p>For experiments that generate paired-end reads, the paired reads are stored in the same BAM file. We also retain unmapped reads and spike-ins (whenever appropriate). Because spike-in reads are &quot;non-chromosomal&quot;, they need to be filtered out before downstream processing. The quality scores for unmapped reads are stored in the same format as in FASTQ files, i.e., Phred+33. Biological replicates are stored in separate BAM files. Multiple lanes of the same library are pooled into a single BAM, with read names containing lane information so that it is possible to decompose the pooled BAM file into individual BAM files by lane.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>BAM mapping parameters</h3>\n\n<p>Due to the diverse data types used in KCE, the choice of mapping algorithms and the parameters used are data type dependent. These parameters include how many mismatches are allowed, whether seed matching is used (only the prefix of each read is used for mapping while the low-quality suffix is discarded), whether reads that map to many locations in the reference are allowed, etc. The consortium aims to specify the settings of these parameters for each individual data type, and these specifications will be released in the future versions of this document. Nonetheless, the settings of all tunable parameters are specified in the header of each BAM file.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAM_format\">Introductory information on the SAM/BAM format</a></p>\n\n<h2><a id=\"vcf\" name=\"vcf\">VCF</a></h2>\n\n<h3>VCF file content</h3>\n\n<p>Variation quantification assays, like WES and WGS, measure individual differences acorss the genome. Reads are sequenced and aligned to a reference genome to generate VCF files, which  use a single general system for representing genetic variation. These files s use a simple haplotype representation for REF and ALT alleles to describe variant haplotypes at a locus. ALT haplotypes are constructed from the REF haplotype by taking the REF allele bases at the POS in the reference genotype and replacing them with the ALT bases</a></p>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n\n<p><a id=\"ref1\" name=\"ref1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;Cock PJ, Fields CJ, Goto N, Heuer ML, Rice PM.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=20015970\">The Sanger FASTQ file format for sequences with quality scores, and the Solexa/Illumina FASTQ variants</a>.&nbsp;<em>Nucleic Acids Res</em>. 2010 Apr;38(6):1767-71.

Each object represents a specific component of the assay or analysis. A schema profile for each object type outlines the set of properties for a given object of that type. For example, a patient is represented by a Patient object, the sample collected from a patient is represented by a Biospecimen object. For a complete list of these schemas, click &quot;Materials &amp; Methods&quot; -&gt; &quot;<a href=\"/profiles/?\">Schemas</a>&quot; at the top of any page.</p>\n\n<p>A property for a given object can &ldquo;link&rdquo; or &ldquo;point&rdquo; to another object on the KCE Portal. For example, an Experiment object has the property <em>replicates</em>, a list containing the Replicate objects associated with that assay. The properties of each Replicate object are embedded directly in the experiment JSON. Each Replicate has properties of additional objects embedded within it as well, including the Library, Biosample, and Donor objects associated with that Replicate (Figure 1). These object relationships form the basis of the core data model for the KCE Portal.

Embedded properties of an example experiment JSON describing associated replicate, library, biosample, and donor objects.</p>\n</center>\n\n<h3>Accessions</h3>\n\n<p>The KCE creates accessions for metadata that can be reused to ensure that the exact patient or biospecimen is being referred to when being discussed or analyzed. Below are some examples of accessions given to certain types of metadata:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>A biospecimen</strong>: An biospecimen accession refers to a tube or sample of that biological material used in an assay. For example, the following would each be given a biospecimen accession: (1) a batch of a cell line grown on a specific day, (2) the isolation of a primary cell culture on a specific day, or (3) the dissection of a tissue sample on a specific day.</li>\n\t<li><strong>A patient</strong>: Every patient is given a patient accession. This accession allows multiple biospecimens obtained from a single patient to be grouped together. </li>\n\t<li><strong>A library</strong>: Each unique library that can be resequenced is given an accession. This accession ensures the correct files are associated with the nucleic acid material created from the biospecimen.</li>\n\t<li><strong>A file</strong>: Each data file available for download is given an accession. The file accession and file format are included in the name of the file itself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Dependencies and Audits</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In order to ensure metadata accuracy, each schema has a set of dependencies to enforce proper modeling when related metadata are submitted.&nbsp;For example, if a FASTQ file is posted, a dependency requires an additional property indicating whether that file is single-ended or paired-ended. If paired-ended is selected, an additional dependency requires the ID of the paired file is included as well. These safeguards ensure that the appropriate metadata are in place prior to the submission of a new object.</p>\n\n<p>After submission, a system of audits are used to identify inconsistencies in the data. While dependencies enforce metadata <em>within</em> an object, audits typically check metadata <em>between</em> linked objects. For example, these data audits include checks that ensure that a ChIP-seq Experiment lists control Experiments with matching biosample metadata and that spike-ins are used for RNA-seq assays. These audits are also used to communicate details of KCE data, such as data quality relative to standards, to the public. Each audit is designated a color depending on its severity, and is displayed on the search page and individual object pages.</p>\n\n",

The findings, published in EBioMedicine, represent the first comprehensive catalog of ccRCC, the most common type of kidney cancer. By applying mathematical models and a co-occurring matrix with superimposed vectorial processes based on tumor size and grade, investigators developed the first morphology-driven evolutionary model of the disease. <a href=\"https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2019/catalog-map-kidney-cancer-tumors.html\">Press Release</a>"

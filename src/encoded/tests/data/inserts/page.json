It achieves this goal by connecting a comprehensive self-updating database of curated clinical-pathological patient data with integrated genomic analyses and research samples.</p>\n\n<p>Kidney Cancer Explorer (KCE) seamlessly integrates up-to-date clinical-pathological data with high-dimensional genomics and research samples into a unified database that supports powerful analytical tools for integrative studies. Data are extracted using automatic queries run monthly from multiple warehouses (EPIC, Co-PATH, Tumor Registry, Mosaic, and Cancer Gene Connect). Raw and patient level data are available through a password-protected system. Exome-seq or RNA-seq is available for over 500 specimens. Information can be linked to an extensive biobank including possibly the largest collection of live tumor samples and kidney cancer tumorgrafts. The database has been designed as a scalable engine to meet the complex and increasing demands of biomedical research. </p>\n\n<p>KCE is the result of a fruitful collaboration between the <a href=\"http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/departments/bioinformatics/\"> Department of Bioinformatics</a>  and the <a href=\"http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/kidney-cancer/\"> Kidney Cancer Program</a> at UT Southwestern.

You can also <a href=\"#search\">use the Search box</a> to search for keywords. Also of note is the &ldquo;Download&rdquo; button to the right which allows users to <a href=\"#download\">batch download files</a>. The <a href=\"#viz\">&ldquo;Visualize&rdquo; button</a> also appears to the right once facets have been selected to filter the number of results to 100 or fewer. The &quot;Add experiment to cart&quot; button is part of the Portal&#39;s cart feature, described in detail <a href=\"/help/cart/\">here</a>. More information about JSON format is available on the <a href=\"/help/rest-api/\">REST API page</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>These results can be filtered by selecting one or more values in a metadata category, also referred to as a &quot;facet,&quot; on the left hand side of the page. Multiple facet values, in the same or different categories, can be selected at any one time to generate more specific queries. To exclude a facet value, click the <i class=\"icon icon-minus-circle\" style=\"color:#FF0000\"> </i> exclusion icon which appears to the right of each facet value when the cursor is hovered above it.

With each selected facet, a parameter is added to your query based on the property and the desired value of that property. For example, in Figure 2, the selection of the H3K4me3 target adds <code>target.label=H3K4me3</code> to your URL:</p>\n\n<pre>\nhttps://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&amp;<strong>target.label=H3K4me3</strong></pre>\n\n<p>Users can use any valid property of an object as a parameter, beyond those listed as facets. Generally, a query will be in the following format:</p>\n\n<pre>\nhttps://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=<strong>Object_type</strong>&amp;<strong>property_1</strong>=<strong>value_1</strong>&amp;<strong>property_2</strong>=<strong>value_2</strong>&amp;...</pre>\n\n<p>Below are some useful tips for query building:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Wildcard (<code>*</code> or <code>%2A</code>) is accepted as a valid property value.</li>\n\t<li>Not equals (<code>!=</code> or <code>%21=</code>) can be used for negation.</li>\n\t<li>Multiple parameters are joined with an <code>&amp;</code>.</li>\n\t<li>To access a sub-property, the sub-property name can be joined to the property name with a <code>.</code>, as in <code>target.label</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Object types and their properties are fully documented in the <a href=\"/profiles/?\">object schemas</a>. It is also helpful to understand the ENCODE Portal&#39;s <a href=\"/help/data-organization\">data model</a>.</p>\n\n<p>An example of an advanced query utilizing the above query building features is the below search, which filters for experiments (<code>type=Experiment</code>) that are released (<code>status=released</code>), not a control (<code>target.label%21=Control</code>), and are part of the ENTEx collaboration (<code>internal_tags=ENTEx</code>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<pre>\nhttps://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&amp;status=released&amp;target.label%21=Control&amp;internal_tags=ENTEx\n</pre>\n\n<p>More information and interactive examples of query building can be found on <a href=\"https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/encodeproject/api/basic_search#/\">Swagger</a>.</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"search\" name=\"search\">Search by keyword</a></h3>\n\n<p>The website can be searched by entering a search term in the search box located in the upper right hand corner in the toolbar (see Figure 1), which appears on every page. This returns relevant results of any object type&nbsp;(such as Experiments, Antibodies, Publications, or others). Due to the number of objects stored on the Portal, only a subset of key properties, which are documented in the <a href=\"/profiles/?\">Schemas</a> for each object type, are searchable with this method.</p>\n\n<p>The search results can be narrowed by object type by selecting an item in the &quot;Data Type&quot;&nbsp;facet&nbsp;on the left hand side of the page, and then further filtered using the displayed facets&nbsp;(refer to the <a href=\"#browse\">&quot;Browse and filter data&quot;</a> section above).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Example search terms include a biosample (e.g.<a href=\"/search/?searchTerm=skin\">&quot;skin&quot;</a>), an assay name (e.g. <a href=\"/search/?searchTerm=ChIP-seq\">&quot;ChIP-seq&quot;</a>), or a protein target of an antibody (e.g. <a href=\"/search/?searchTerm=CTCF\">&quot;CTCF&quot;</a>).</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"region\" name=\"region\">Search by region</a></h3>\n\n<p>It is possible to search for experiments by region using <a href=\"/region-search/\">Region Search</a>, located in the &quot;Data&quot; drop down menu. It accepts coordinates and gene names among other forms of region identifiers and returns experiments for which the input region intersects regions specified in the peaks file.</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"exptpage\" name=\"exptpage\">Viewing experiment pages</a></h3>\n\n<p>After searching for experiments, clicking on a link to a specific experiment will bring you to the experiment summary page:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"fig fig-align-center\" style=\"width:90%\"><img src=\"/images/20ac7c1e-6800-4421-bda1-b492a5e62801/@@download/attachment/exptpage_gettingstarted_1909.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 4.

Towards the right, there is also a browser selector, which will allow you to choose between UCSC, Ensembl, or Juicebox genome browsers. Files must be in bigBed or bigWig file format to be visualized as a track hub, or hic format to be visualized using Juicebox. Click the &quot;Visualize&quot; button to open the external genome browser.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"fig fig-align-center fig-width-75\"><img src=\"/images/c183d4fe-f86b-4c8c-910b-7c92b626c0da/@@download/attachment/Visualize_1908_external.png\" />\n<figcaption>Figure 6. Use the Assembly and Browser selectors in the File details tab and then click Visualize to go to a new tab with applicable files from the experiment loaded as tracks in the genome browser.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The &quot;Visualize&quot; button also appears on Search and Matrix view pages (see Fig.&nbsp;1) once filtered to a maximum of 100 experiments, provided there are released experiments with visualizable files&nbsp;within that set, as shown in <a href=\"/?walkme=19-401327\" target=\"_blank\">this tutorial</a> (link opens in new tab). By clicking &quot;Visualize&quot; from a search page, you can open a genome browser view with track hubs for each experiment in the search results, allowing you to visualize data from multiple experiments simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p align=\"right\"><strong><a href=\"#use\">Back to top</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #BFBFBF\"><a id=\"download\" name=\"download\">Download files</a></h3>\n\n<p>Links to download individual files are available beside each file accession listed in the file section of each experiment page (see above in Fig. 4), as well as on each file&#39;s individual page. Files can be downloaded directly from the web page. Alternatively, the link can be copied to be downloaded using the command line, as in the below examples:</p>\n\n<p>Via the wget command:</p>\n\n<pre>\n &gt; wget https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF002CTW/@@download/ENCFF002CTW.bed.gz</pre>\n\n<p>Or via the curl command:</p>\n\n<pre>\n &gt; curl -O -L https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF002CTW/@@download/ENCFF002CTW.bed.gz</pre>\n\n<p>There are multiple options for downloading more than one file. While browsing through experiments (see &quot;<a href=\"#browse\">Browse and filter data</a>&quot;), a &quot;Download&quot; button appears near the top of the page (see Fig. 2), which brings up a batch download pop-up window with instructions on how to download the files of all experiments found with the current query. A tutorial going over <a href=\"?walkme=19-401304\" target=\"_blank\">batch download</a> is available (link opens in new tab.) The cart feature, described below, can also be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that if ENCODE data is used in your publication or talk, the accessions of the datasets used should be cited, along with the most recent ENCODE Consortium publication. Complete guidelines are available on the <a href=\"/help/citing-encode/\">Citing ENCODE page</a>.</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"cart\" name=\"cart\">Cart</a></h3>\n\n<p>The Portal has a cart function, which allows users to select and group together arbitrary experiments. Carts can be shared with colleagues; it is also possible to batch download all the files of the experiments placed in the cart. When viewing the cart, the file selectors located in the sidebar can be used to filter for only files meeting certain conditions, such as assembly used or file format, prior to performing a batch download.&nbsp;Detailed information on how to use the cart is located on the <a href=\"/help/cart/\">Cart page</a>, and Cart basics are demonstrated in <a href=\"/?walkme=19-402187\" target=\"_blank\">this tutorial</a> (link opens in new tab).</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"programmatic\" name=\"programmatic\">Programmatic access to the Portal</a></h3>\n\n<p>In addition to web-based browsing and searching, the ENCODE Portal can be accessed programmatically via the REST API. Instructions on how to browse and search for ENCODE data programmatically are provided in the <a href=\"/help/rest-api\">REST API help document</a>. In brief, all queries (see <a href=\"#query\">Query building</a>) that can be performed via the web can be used as programmatic queries. Programmatic access provides additional methods to download files by retrieving direct URLs of files from JSON data objects.</p>\n\n<p align=\"right\"><strong><a href=\"#use\">Back to top</a></strong></p>\n"

                "body": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Direct interaction with the ENCODE DCC metadata database is typically done through scripts you write and execute on your own Mac, PC or server. Your scripts interact with the database through an industry-standard, Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol-(HTTP)-based, Representational-state-transfer (RESTful) application programming interface (API). Data objects exchanged with the server conform to the standard JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. JSON is a defined data interchange format that is used web-wide. If you&rsquo;re familiar with JavaScript&rsquo;s object literal notation or Python&rsquo;s dictionary datatype, then JSON-formatted text will look familiar. You will almost certainly use libraries for your language of choice to handle the network connection and parse the objects returned (<a href=\"http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/\">requests</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html\">json</a> for Python, for example). We have written example scripts you can look at <a href=\"https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/submission_sample_scripts\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>Quickstart examples</h2>\n\n<p>While getting objects from the database can often be done in just a few lines of code, here are some quick ways of testing your connection and exploring the ENCODE data objects without writing any code.</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>A JSON pretty-printer plugin for your web browser, such as JSONView (for <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en\">Chrome</a> or <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/jsonview/\">Firefox</a>) or json-lite&nbsp;(for <a href=\"https://github.com/rfletcher/safari-json-formatter/downloads\">Safari</a>)</li>\n\t<li>The <code>curl</code> command, which ships with Mac OSX and all major LINUX/UNIX implementations. If you don&#39;t have <code>curl</code>, an executable can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin\">here</a>. Make sure you get the SSL and SSH aware version. You will find <code>curl</code> useful later for debugging your scripts (it always works), so if you don&#39;t already have it, you&#39;ll want to get it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3><a id=\"json-in-browser\" name=\"json-in-browser\">ENCODE JSON in your browser</a></h3>\n\n<p>Look at biosample ENCBS000AAA at <a class=\"\\&quot;url\\&quot;\" href=\"/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/\">https://www.encodeproject.org/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"fig-align-center fig-width-50\" src=\"/images/366b6881-afe0-4001-a22c-3e0803ecfcbf/@@download/attachment/rest_api_page.png\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 347px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>By clicking the JSON button, which looks like <code>{;}</code>, you should see the page viewed as JSON. Alternatively,&nbsp;you can manually add the following parameter to the URL: <code>/?format=json</code></p>\n\n<p><img class=\"fig-align-left fig-width-50\" src=\"/images/7aaac70e-de90-4546-ae7f-60be5e376512/@@download/attachment/json_browser_hires.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 375px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>By adding the <code>/?format=json</code> parameter, you&#39;ve instructed the ENCODE webserver to send you the raw contents of the database record for ENCBS000AAA, in JSON format. Rather than being rendered in your browser, you see the native JSON object as it is stored in the ENCODE database. This is a biosample object, and you will see all the properties and their values for this object. You need a JSON pretty printer (see prerequisites above) in order to make sense of the JSON. Notice that many of the object&rsquo;s properties contain other (nested) objects.</p>\n\n<p>Notice also that the object has its own URL, and that the URL corresponds to the object&rsquo;s accession number. This always works to access ENCODE objects. <em>In fact, because accession numbers are unique, you can construct a URL from the accession number alone and the server will return your object.</em> For example, the resource <a class=\"\\&quot;url\\&quot;\" href=\"https://www.encodeproject.org/ENCBS000AAA\">https://www.encodeproject.org/ENCBS000AAA</a>&nbsp;maps to the same object&nbsp;identified by the longer URL&nbsp;<a class=\"\\&quot;url\\&quot;\" href=\"/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/\">https://www.encodeproject.org/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/</a></p>\n\n<p>As you learn more about the ENCODE REST API, you&rsquo;ll see that when you retrieve objects (using the HTTP &ldquo;GET&rdquo; method) from the server, they always come back as JSON.</p>\n\n<h3><a id=\"json-command-line\" name=\"json-command-line\">A simple command-line GET</a></h3>\n\n<p>Try this in a terminal window:</p>\n\n<pre>\n$ curl -H &quot;Accept: application/json&quot; https://www.encodeproject.org/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/</pre>\n\n<p>You should see lots of text that starts with something like &quot;{&quot;system_slims&quot;: [], &quot;accession&quot;: &quot;ENCBS000AAA&quot;, ...&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"fig-align-center fig-width-75\" src=\"/images/354f5ee9-7989-43ef-808f-08692dd24da7/@@download/attachment/curl_json.png\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 213px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Your command instructs <code>curl</code> to download the database record for the ENCODE biosample ENCBS000AAA in JSON format (it&#39;s the same object rendered above and at <a href=\"/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/\">https://www.encodeproject.org/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/</a>). In fact, the ENCODE server sees that the request is coming from something other than a web browser running the ENCODE web app, so it returns the object in JSON format. All <code>curl</code> is really doing is downloading the &quot;web page&quot; that corresponds to that ENCODE record. Transport is by HTTP, just like a web browser.</p>\n\n<p>This sort of JSON-formatted text is sometimes referred to as a &quot;JSON document&quot;. You can redirect the output to a file:</p>\n\n<pre>\n$ curl -L -H &quot;Accept: application/json&quot; <a href=\"https://www.encodeproject.org/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/\">https://www.encodeproject.org/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/</a> &gt; ENCBS000AAA.json\n$ less ENCBS000AAA.json</pre>\n\n<p>In this example, the <code>-L</code> option tells <code>curl</code> to follow redirects. While not necessary in this example, <code>-L</code> is necessary for identifiers, like aliases, that get redirected to another resource. In cases like that, without <code>-L</code> you may see something like:</p>\n\n<pre>\n{&quot;status&quot;: &quot;error&quot;, &quot;code&quot;: 301, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Moved Permanently&quot; ... }</pre>\n\n<p>If in doubt, use <code>curl -L</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If you supply an invalid identifier (like an accession number that doesn&#39;t refer to anything), you&#39;ll see something like:</p>\n\n<pre>\n{&quot;status&quot;: &quot;error&quot;, &quot;code&quot;: 404, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The resource could not be found.&quot; ... }</pre>\n\n<p>You can see that even error responses come back in JSON format. This makes parsing the results of your queries much easier.</p>\n\n<p>To pretty-print JSON on the command line, you can use the&nbsp;<code>jq</code> utility, available <a href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/\">here</a>. To use it with the&nbsp;output of <code>curl</code>, you can simply pipe its output to <code>jq</code>:</p>\n\n<pre>\ncurl -H &quot;Accept: application/json&quot; <a href=\"https://www.encodeproject.org/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/\">https://www.encodeproject.org/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/</a> | jq\n</pre>\n\n<h3>REST, JSON and curl in perspective</h3>\n\n<p>As you develop your scripts, curl can be a valuable testing tool. If you can get an object with a curl command, you should be able to get it with your script.</p>\n\n<p>The important thing to remember is that each ENCODE object is accessible via a simple URL containing an identifier (like an accession number) for that object. That&#39;s all curl does, that&#39;s all your browser does, and that&#39;s all your scripts will do. The resource you GET, using that URL, will be in JSON format. You will then use a library to parse the JSON and construct a native data structure (like a Python dictionary).</p>\n\n<h2>The ENCODE REST API</h2>\n\n<p>The ENCODE REST API uses GET to transport JSON-formatted information between the server and your scripts.</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>A library or module for your language of choice that supports HTTP. The <code>requests</code> library <a href=\"http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for Python is good, and will be used for examples in this documentation.</li>\n\t<li>A library or module for parsing JSON-structured text and building native data structures. The Python <code>json</code>&nbsp;library <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> is good.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3><a id=\"json-script\" name=\"json-script\">GET</a></h3>\n\n<p>The HTTP GET request&nbsp;is used to retrieve objects from the ENCODE server. GET will work without a username and password to fetch publicly-released ENCODE objects. Sending a GET request&nbsp;is accomplished here by using the <code>requests.get()</code> method.</p>\n\n<pre>\nimport requests, json\n&nbsp;\n<em># Force return from the server in JSON format</em>\nheaders = {&#39;accept&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;}\n&nbsp;\n<em># This URL locates the ENCODE biosample with accession number ENCBS000AAA</em>\nurl = &#39;https://www.encodeproject.org/biosample/ENCBS000AAA/?frame=object&#39;\n&nbsp;\n<em># GET the object</em>\nresponse = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n&nbsp;\n<em># Extract the JSON response as a Python dictionary</em>\nbiosample = response.json()\n\n# Print the Python object\nprint(json.dumps(biosample, indent=4))\n</pre>\n\n<p>This script GET&#39;s the JSON representation of ENCODE biosample ENCBS000AAA. The ENCODE server&#39;s JSON response is extracted as a Python dictionary using the <code>response.json()</code> method. The dictionary is then dumped back to a string and pretty-printed with useful indentation.</p>\n\n<p>The output should look something like:</p>\n\n<pre>\n{\n    &quot;biosample_ontology&quot;: &quot;/biosample-types/cell_line_EFO_0001203/&quot;,\n    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;mammary gland, adenocarcinoma&quot;,\n    &quot;donor&quot;: &quot;/human-donors/ENCDO000AAE/&quot;,\n    &quot;passage_number&quot;: 5,\n    &quot;lab&quot;: &quot;/labs/richard-myers/&quot;,\n    &quot;accession&quot;: &quot;ENCBS000AAA&quot;,\n    &quot;parent_of&quot;: [],\n    &quot;@type&quot;: [\n        &quot;Biosample&quot;,\n        &quot;Item&quot;\n    ],\n    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://www.atcc.org/Products/All/HTB-22.aspx&quot;,\n    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;released&quot;,\n    &quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;56e94f2b-25ac-4c58-9828-f63b66220999&quot;\n    &quot;notes&quot;: &quot;(PMID: 4357757)&quot;,\n    &quot;award&quot;: &quot;/awards/U54HG004576/&quot;,\n    &quot;age_display&quot;: &quot;69 year&quot;,\n    &quot;product_id&quot;: &quot;HTB-22&quot;,\n    &quot;culture_harvest_date&quot;: &quot;2012-04-10&quot;,\n    &quot;applied_modifications&quot;: [],\n    &quot;dbxrefs&quot;: [\n        &quot;UCSC-ENCODE-cv:MCF-7&quot;\n    ],\n    &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;/biosamples/ENCBS000AAA/&quot;,\n    &quot;culture_start_date&quot;: &quot;2012-03-16&quot;,\n    &quot;life_stage&quot;: &quot;adult&quot;,\n    &quot;organism&quot;: &quot;/organisms/human/&quot;,\n    &quot;aliases&quot;: [\n        &quot;richard-myers:MCF7-003&quot;\n    ],\n    &quot;health_status&quot;: &quot;breast cancer (adenocarcinoma)&quot;,\n    &quot;internal_tags&quot;: [],\n    &quot;references&quot;: [],\n    &quot;age_units&quot;: &quot;year&quot;,\n    &quot;characterizations&quot;: [],\n    &quot;submitted_by&quot;: &quot;/users/df9f3c8e-b819-4885-8f16-08f6ef0001e8/&quot;,\n    &quot;date_created&quot;: &quot;2013-12-12T05:50:02.101495+00:00&quot;,\n    &quot;alternate_accessions&quot;: [],\n    &quot;source&quot;: &quot;/sources/atcc/&quot;,\n    &quot;age&quot;: &quot;69&quot;,\n    &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Homo sapiens MCF-7 cell line&quot;,\n    &quot;genetic_modifications&quot;: [],\n    &quot;schema_version&quot;: &quot;24&quot;,\n    &quot;sex&quot;: &quot;female&quot;,\n    &quot;treatments&quot;: [],\n    &quot;documents&quot;: [\n        &quot;/documents/984071d4-9149-476a-b353-93592c6f48f3/&quot;\n    ]\n}</pre>\n\n<p>The important point is that the response object has been cast into a native Python dict datastructure. For example, documents is an array of document identifiers and so you can loop over that array.</p>\n\n<p>Adding the following code to the example script above loops through the documents array, GET&#39;s each document object, and prints its description:</p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>for</strong> doc_uri <strong>in</strong> biosample[&#39;documents&#39;]:\n\tdoc_response = requests.get(&#39;https://www.encodeproject.org/&#39; + doc_uri, headers=headers)\n\tdocument = doc_response.json()\n\t<strong>print</strong> document[&#39;description&#39;]</pre>\n\n<p>Which prints:</p>\n\n<pre>\nMCF-7 Cell Culture and 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment\n</pre>\n\n<h2><a id=\"programmatic-search\" name=\"programmatic-search\">Programmatic search</a></h2>\n\n<p>In the GET example above, we use the ENCODE REST API to retrieve an individual object using its ENCODE accession number. You can also search for objects programmatically and get the search result back in JSON format. The ENCODE web app is a good place to start to see an example. Enter the string &quot;bone chip&quot; in the search box at the top right of the page at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.encodeproject.org/\">https://www.encodeproject.org/</a>. The result are those ENCODE objects that match that string. Note that these results are by default&nbsp;not restricted to experiments, but include other object types as well. The object&nbsp;types of the&nbsp;results, among other properties, can be filtered using the facets to the left of the results.</p>\n\n<h3>Search URL format</h3>\n\n<p>The same URL that returns the search results to the web app can be used in a script. This script does the same search and returns the results in JSON format:</p>\n\n<pre>\nimport requests, json\n\n# Force return from the server in JSON format\nheaders = {&#39;accept&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;}\n\n# This searches the ENCODE database for the phrase &quot;bone chip&quot;\nurl = &#39;https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?searchTerm=bone+chip&amp;frame=object&#39;\n\n# GET the search result\nresponse = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n\n# Extract the JSON response as a python dictionary\nsearch_results = response.json()\n\n# <i>Print the object</i>\nprint(json.dumps(search_results, indent=4))\n</pre>\n\n<p>The structure of the response will be as follows. Keys with array values are denoted with <code>[...]</code> and keys with object values are denoted with <code>{...}</code>:</p>\n\n<pre>\n{\n    &quot;notification&quot;: &quot;Success&quot;,\n    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Search&quot;,\n    &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;/search/?searchTerm=bone+chip&quot;,\n    &quot;clear_filters&quot;: &quot;/search/?searchTerm=bone+chip&quot;,\n    &quot;columns&quot;: {...},\n    &quot;all&quot;: &quot;/?searchTerm=bone+chip&amp;limit=all&quot;,\n    &quot;facets&quot;: [...],\n    &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;/terms/&quot;,\n    &quot;@type&quot;: [...],\n    &quot;total&quot;: 180,\n    &quot;filters&quot;: [...],\n    &quot;@graph&quot;: [...]\n}</pre>\n\n<p>The <code>@graph</code> property in the response script contains the array of search results, it should look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre>\n[\n    {\n        &quot;authors&quot;: &quot;Johnson ME, Deliard S, Zhu F, Xia Q, Wells AD, Hankenson KD, Grant SF&quot;,\n        &quot;identifiers&quot;: [\n            &quot;PMID:24337390&quot;\n        ],\n        &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A ChIP-seq-defined genome-wide map of MEF2C binding reveals inflammatory pathways associated with its role in bone density determination.&quot;,\n        &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;/publications/03e13868-6090-4f61-b4f1-b4a22a6e833a/&quot;,\n        &quot;issue&quot;: &quot;4&quot;,\n        &quot;data_used&quot;: &quot;ENCODE TF ChIP used throughout, Figures 1-2&quot;,\n        &quot;journal&quot;: &quot;Calcified tissue international&quot;,\n        &quot;volume&quot;: &quot;94&quot;,\n        &quot;date_created&quot;: &quot;2014-08-13T01:26:28.846038+00:00&quot;,\n        &quot;@type&quot;: [\n            &quot;Publication&quot;,\n            &quot;Item&quot;\n        ],\n        &quot;date_published&quot;: &quot;2014 Apr&quot;,\n        ...\n    },\n    {\n     &quot;biosample_ontology&quot;: {\n            &quot;term_name&quot;: &quot;bone marrow&quot;,\n            &quot;classification&quot;: &quot;tissue&quot;\n        },\n        &quot;replicates&quot;: [\n            {\n                &quot;antibody&quot;: {\n                    &quot;accession&quot;: &quot;ENCAB000ADX&quot;\n                },\n                &quot;biological_replicate_number&quot;: 1,\n                &quot;technical_replicate_number&quot;: 1,\n                &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;/replicates/8ca96774-c0d1-4f62-b7d3-f2988d406de2/&quot;,\n                &quot;library&quot;: {\n                    &quot;biosample&quot;: {\n                        &quot;age_units&quot;: &quot;week&quot;,\n                        &quot;life_stage&quot;: &quot;adult&quot;,\n                        &quot;organism&quot;: {\n                            &quot;scientific_name&quot;: &quot;Mus musculus&quot;\n                        },\n                        &quot;accession&quot;: &quot;ENCBS130ENC&quot;,\n                        &quot;age&quot;: &quot;8&quot;\n&nbsp;                   }\n&nbsp;               }\n&nbsp;           },\n&nbsp;           ...\n&nbsp;       ]\n&nbsp;   }, \n    ...\n]</pre>\n\n<p>Whereas before, when we retrieved a single object, the @graph property was a list with only one element. Now @graph is a multi-element list, with each object that satisfies the search condition represented as one entry. Note that there are multiple types of objects returned by the query because we did not specify a <code>type</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;objects returned contain only a subset of the properties. These are the properties that the server returns to the web app to render the search results page. To get the full objects back, add&nbsp;<code>&amp;frame=object</code> to the query. The query URL looks like:</p>\n\n<pre>\nurl = &#39;https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?searchTerm=bone+chip&amp;frame=object&amp;format=json&#39;</pre>\n\n<p>This returns the full objects, with all their properties and values.

So it&rsquo;s consistent, and it&rsquo;s faster. Which embedded objects are expanded by <code>frame=embedded</code> may change in the future as our requirements for search change. Also, the depth of expansion is chosen to support search and might change&nbsp;as well. So, for the most robust code you might choose to use <code>frame=object</code> and then GET only the embedded objects you need.</li>\n\t<li>You do not need to specify <code>frame=embedded</code> in order to search within embedded objects. For example, the query paramater <code>lab.state=CA</code> would work when searching with&nbsp;<code>frame=object</code></li>\n\t<li>All of the results from search can be visualized within the web app by opening the URL in your browser, omitting <code>format=json</code>. Not all objects have fancy rendered collections or pages, but you will always get back a clickable list.</li>\n\t<li><code>limit=all</code> is not strictly necessary but without it your result will contain only the first 25 hits (or all if &lt; 25 hits). We plan to implement a mechanism to return very large searches in batches, but for now <code>limit=all</code> can generate large result sets.</li>\n\t<li>Giving <code>searchTerm=somestring</code> will often return multiple object types. You can look into the <code>@type</code> property of each returned object for its data type.</li>\n\t<li>To make a search specifying that a property is NOT equal to a value (negation), use the <code>!=</code> operator (see example 9 above)</li>\n\t<li>The <code>*</code> character can be used as a wildcard, matching any value. This is useful when you would like to check the existence or non-existence of a property. Specifing <code>property=*</code> will return objects for which the property is both present and non-empty. It can be used with <code>!=</code> as well to search for objects where a property is missing or empty.</li>\n</ul>\n",

As with search-result pages, you can easily generate a list of downloadable URLs for all files in all experiments in your cart along with experimental metadata for all files you download.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the most basic form of carts in which they only exist in your browser window&rsquo;s memory. Later we&rsquo;ll look at logging in with a user account to save carts and share them with others.</p>\n\n<h3>Adding many experiments to your cart.</h3>\n\n<p>The search-results page has a convenient way to add many experiments to your cart at once.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-wrapper selecting-experiment-search-results\"><img alt=\"Select experiment search results with the Search item under the Data menu\" src=\"/images/3599ae8c-064a-4878-aeee-9ac096023f31/@@download/attachment/selecting-experiment-search-results.png\" />\n<figcaption>Selecting experiment search results</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Any experiments in your search results displays a cart button to its right. Carts cannot include other types of items &mdash; non-experiment items do not have a cart button to their right.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/images/fe4afebe-4be4-4990-91f6-016ac94a468e/@@download/attachment/experiment-search-results.png\" />\n<figcaption>View of experiment search results with cart button highlighted</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Carts can contain up to 4000 experiments, but a large number of experiments in your cart can cause certain operations to take a long time to complete. Filtering your experiments down to as small a set as possible helps keep the performance of cart operations high. The following example has the &ldquo;eCLIP&rdquo; filter selected which reduces the number of search results to 469 experiments.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/images/a0233689-7eb3-4c4c-b5ff-8a62a2009e85/@@download/attachment/experiments-added-to-cart.png\" />\n<figcaption>After adding multiple experiments to a cart</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>With these 469 experiments selected, clicking the &ldquo;Add all items to cart&rdquo; button adds them to your cart, and a cart menu that shows the number of items in your cart appears next to the Help menu.</p>\n\n<h3>Viewing your cart</h3>\n\n<p>Choosing &ldquo;View cart&rdquo; from the cart menu takes you to the Cart page with the https://www.encodeproject.org/cart-view/ URL. Unlike most ENCODE portal URLs, this URL only shows your cart contents in this web browser window, and other people going to the same URL don&rsquo;t see your cart but might see their own cart contents, and you don&rsquo;t see these cart contents in a different browser window.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/images/80e83f81-c2b1-453d-a8aa-b3ec27d21a56/@@download/attachment/cart_view_190612.jpg\" />\n<figcaption>View of cart</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The main portion of the Cart page displays a list of the experiments in your cart. You only see 25 experiments at a time, and the experiment pager lets you move between the pages of 25 experiments.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the similarly appearing search-result pages, the file selectors do <em>not</em> filter your list of experiments in your cart. Instead, they select the files you download based on the specified properties. Having nothing selected causes all files associated with all the experiments in your cart to download. Selecting for one or more properties, such as an assembly of &quot;GRCh38&quot; shown in the image above, causes only the files with the chosen properties associated with all the experiments in your cart to download. Currently, files for download can be filtered by their output type, file type, genome assembly, lab, and status. As you choose different combinations of properties, you can see the number of files selected for download above the file selectors.</p>\n\n<p>A large number of experiments in your cart can cause the file selectors to take a long time to appear.</p>\n\n<h3>Downloading files</h3>\n\n<p>The &ldquo;Download&rdquo; button, much like the Download button on search-result pages, pops up a dialog box that gives you information about downloading all the selected files in all the experiments in your cart.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/images/dfd26f96-d1cf-4a93-934a-69258b3bde68/@@download/attachment/download-dialog.png\" />\n<figcaption>File download dialog</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Once you click the &ldquo;Download&rdquo; button in the dialog box, a file called &ldquo;files.txt&rdquo; gets downloaded that contains the URLs of all the selected files, as well as a line to generate and download a &ldquo;metadata.tsv&rdquo; file that contains a listing of the same files along with their experimental metadata.</p>\n\n<p>If you have more than 500 experiments in your cart, you also see the warning in red. Clicking the Download button when you have a large number of experiments in your cart can result in a long delay before the &ldquo;files.txt&rdquo; file begins downloading. During this delay, you can still use the portal, but buttons that modify your cart appear dimmed until &ldquo;files.txt&rdquo; has finished downloading.</p>\n\n<h3>Adding and removing individual experiments</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to adding multiple experiments to your cart and clearing your cart, you can also add and remove individual experiments.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned before, the search-results page shows a cart button to the right of experiments. This button appears filled in for experiments currently in your cart, and as an outline for experiments not in your cart. Clicking the cart button of an experiment in your cart removes it from the cart, and the button appears as an outline. Clicking the cart button of an experiment <em>not</em> in your cart adds it to your cart, and the button appears filled in.</p>\n\n<p>You can also add and remove experiments on individual experiment pages using a button above the summary.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-wrapper add-to-cart\"><img src=\"/images/012b27ed-4bbe-44fe-b63b-1b967da29d30/@@download/attachment/add-to-cart.png\" width=\"200\" />\n<figcaption><i>Add to cart</i> button on an experiment</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h3>Clearing your cart</h3>\n\n<p>Once you no longer need your cart, click the &ldquo;Clear cart&rdquo; button on your cart page. You get a chance to back out of this action, or to continue. Once you clear your cart, you cannot bring its contents back.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to clear your cart involves clearing your browser window&rsquo;s memory by reloading the browser or visiting another website while you have items in your cart. When you do this, you see a generic alert that lets you back out of clearing your browser window&rsquo;s memory in case you do this by accident.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"saved-carts\">Saving and sharing carts with user accounts</h2>\n\n<p>Carts have more abilities when you have logged in with your user account on the ENCODE portal, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Saving your carts so they can be recalled</li>\n\t<li>Sharing saved carts with others</li>\n\t<li>Adding more than 4000 items to your carts, with a corresponding performance penalty on the cart page as you add more items</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The following sections describe additional cart abilities when you have logged in.</p>\n\n<p>Please contact our <a href=\"mailto:encode-help@lists.stanford.edu\" title=\"Email encode-help@lists.stanford.edu\">Help Desk</a> if you need an account, or if your old account does not work.</p>\n\n<h3>Saving your cart</h3>\n\n<p>Once you have logged in with your ENCODE portal user account, carts automatically get saved to the ENCODE portal as you add and remove items &mdash; you don&rsquo;t need to specifically save your cart. You can view your carts on different browsers and computers, and you don&rsquo;t lose this cart by reloading the browser window or going to a different website.</p>\n\n<h3>Sharing your cart</h3>\n\n<p>You can share your cart with others through the &ldquo;Share cart&rdquo; item in your cart menu.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-wrapper image-80\"><img src=\"/images/32d9142f-266d-4c59-b746-37122e03d99b/@@download/attachment/share-cart-menu.png\" />\n<figcaption>Selecting <em>Share cart</em> menu, including your default cart name</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Selecting this item brings up a dialog box that lets you copy the unique URL to your cart. Others who visit this URL can see the contents of your cart, though they cannot modify your cart &mdash; only you can modify your own cart.</p>\n\n<p>Notice this cart also has a name &mdash; &ldquo;Lorem Ipsum cart&rdquo; in this case for the user &ldquo;Lorem Ipsum.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll look at cart names in more detail below.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"managing-multiple-carts\">Managing multiple carts</h2>\n\n<p>Logged-in users can have up to 30 independent carts, each containing its own set of experiments that can overlap with your other carts&rsquo; sets of experiments. You set one of your carts as the &ldquo;current cart,&rdquo; and all of the operations described above apply to that cart until you set another of your carts as the current cart.</p>\n\n<p>Each cart has a name that must be unique among all your carts. You can also optionally assign an identifier to each cart that you can use in the URL for your cart when you share it. This identifier must be unique among all carts in the system, even if they belong to other users.</p>\n\n<p>Every user gets one cart initially with a name starting with that user&rsquo;s name. In the example given below, user &ldquo;Lorem Ipsum&rdquo; has an initial cart called &ldquo;Lorem Ipsum cart.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h3>Cart Manager</h3>\n\n<p>When logged in, choose the &ldquo;Cart manager&rdquo; option from the cart menu which brings up a page showing a list of all the carts belonging to you.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/images/282adad1-b8de-42e3-aa1b-e6d066460bc9/@@download/attachment/cart-manager-initial.png\" />\n<figcaption>The cart manager as it appears with the initial cart</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h3>Adding a new cart</h3>\n\n<p>To add new carts, click the <em>New cart</em> button at the upper-right corner of the list. This brings up a modal that lets you specify the name and optional identifier for the new cart.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/images/ec213455-f3e9-4d0f-8dfc-f2dd84a782c8/@@download/attachment/new-cart-dialog.png\" />\n<figcaption><em>New cart</em> dialog box</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The notes below each field describe the limitations for the name and identifier. The arrow button in the middle lets you toggle automatic-transfer mode, so clicking it enables the automatic transfer of the name you enter to the identifier (the button appears with a dark background) and clicking this button again disables automatic transfer. While you have automatic transfer enabled, anything you type into the name field gets copied to the identifier field but modified to work better as a part of a URL, so spaces get converted to dashes, and anything not a standard letter or number gets converted to dashes or ignored depending on what those characters are. You can also type directly into the identifier field, with the same limitations on the kinds of characters you can enter.</p>\n\n<p>Once you feel satisfied with the name and optional identifier, click the <em>New cart</em> button to create this cart, and you then see your new cart in your list of carts. If you had left the identifier field blank, the new cart has all the same abilities as any other cart but it gets an automatically assigned identifier.</p>\n\n<h3>Setting the current cart</h3>\n\n<p>You only work with one cart at a time, so you need to set one of your carts as the &ldquo;current cart.&rdquo; You do this in the cart manager by clicking the button in the <em>Current</em> column on the right side of the cart&rsquo;s line in the list of carts, which also highlights that cart in blue. Once you do that, all cart operations &mdash; adding to the cart, viewing the cart, downloading the cart&rsquo;s files, etc. &mdash; apply to that cart.</p>\n\n<p>While all your carts and their contents are part of the ENCODE database, your web browser keeps track of the current cart. If you switch to a different browser or a different computer, you could see a different cart set as the current cart.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"img-wrapper\"><img src=\"/images/8a3030f4-a8f6-418e-92a3-646745b94595/@@download/attachment/current-cart-display.png\" />\n<figcaption>The current cart selected and reflected in the cart menu</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h3>Renaming, sharing, and deleting carts</h3>\n\n<p>The <em>Actions</em> column of the cart manager has the three operations you can perform on a cart: rename, share, and delete.</p>\n\n<p>Renaming a cart brings up the same dialog box as creating a new cart and gives you the same options.</p>\n\n<p>Sharing a cart brings up the same dialog box as sharing a cart from the cart menu. However, you can share <em>any</em> cart with the cart manager whether the current cart or other carts.</p>\n\n<p>When you delete a cart and confirm that you mean to delete it, you can no longer retrieve that cart. Deleting a cart also frees its identifier if it had one &mdash; its identifier becomes available for other carts. You cannot delete the current cart; to delete a cart you have to set a different cart as the current cart first.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"auto-save-carts\">Auto Save carts</h3>\n\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t logged in and you start collecting items into a cart and then you log in, those items automatically get saved to a special cart called &ldquo;Auto Save&rdquo; that appears in yellow in the cart manager. This cart has no identifier, and you cannot rename it, share it from the cart manager, or set it as the current cart.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge the auto-save cart&rsquo;s contents into your current cart. To do this, go to the cart manager and make sure you have set the cart you want to merge the auto-save cart&rsquo;s items into as the current cart. Then click the &ldquo;Auto Save&rdquo; cart&rsquo;s link in the list to view the auto-save cart&rsquo;s contents. Above the contents you find the &ldquo;Add to current cart&rdquo; button. When you click this button, all the contents of the auto-save cart get merged into the current cart, without duplicates.</p>\n\n<p>You never have more than one auto-save cart, so if you already have one and you log in again with items in the logged-out cart, those new items get merged into your existing auto-save cart&rsquo;s items.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"tutorial-video\">Tutorial video</h2>\n\n<div class=\"iframe-container\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/98jVfXIbiLk\"></iframe></div>\n"

[<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a>]</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#bam\">BAM:</a> The Sequence Alignment/Mapping (SAM) format is a text-based format for storing read alignments against reference sequences and it is interconvertible with the binary BAM format. [<a href=\"#ref1\">2</a>]</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#bigwig\">bigWig:</a> The bigWig format is an indexed binary format for rapid display of continuous and dense data in the UCSC Genome Browser.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#bigbed\">bigBed:</a> The bigBed format is also an indexed binary format for rapid display of annotation items such as a linked collection of exons or the binding peaks of a transcription factor.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"#hic\">hic</a>: The hic format is a binary format for storing contact matrices and annotations of chromatin structural features generated from Hi-C or other proximity mapping assays.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These file formats were originally designed to be generic and flexible. As the ENCODE consortium is a collaborative effort, the consortium has made several specifications on the file formats to facilitate data archival, presentation, and distribution, as well as integrative analysis on the data. The consortium considers FASTQ as the basic file format for archival purpose and thus the FASTQ format&#39;s specifications aim to preserve the raw sequence data. In comparison, the other file formats are geared towards data visualization and dissemination, thus their specifications aim to facilitate user-friendliness. Additional information about the file formats can be viewed at the <a href=\"http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#ENCODE\">UCSC Genome Browser ENCODE-specific File Formats</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><a id=\"fastq\" name=\"fastq\">FASTQ</a></h2>\n\n<h3>FASTQ file content</h3>\n\n<p>FASTQ files are submitted as they come off the sequencing instrument to allow for maximal decision making of downstream users. The files are accompanied by documentation detailing how the sequencing libraries were constructed to inform the end-user about how they might want to process the data, the strengths and limitations of the various options of data processing, and how these may apply according to the user&#39;s biological questions of interest.</p>\n\n<p>ENCODE produces replicate data for most experiments to quantify reliability. Biological replicates involve different biological samples, e.g., different tissue preparations for cell growth and expansion when cell lines are used. Biological replicates are contrasted with technical replicates, for which different sequencing libraries are prepared from the same sample, or different sequencing lanes for the same library. Reads from different replicates are stored in separate files and should include flow cell and lane ID. If multiple lanes are used for the same biological or technical replicate, they are stored in the same file (after a QC check to eliminate failed lanes), with information on flow cell and lane ID included. For experiments that produce paired-end reads, the two reads in each pair are stored in two separate files, with the reads in the same order in the two files.</p>\n\n<p>The reads in FASTQ files are unfiltered, i.e., barcodes, adapter sequences, and spike-ins remain in the files. For Illumina sequencing, the barcodes that are in the so-called third read position should not be present in the sequence. Spike-in reads are kept. For bisulfite sequencing experiments, the raw FASTQ files are presented, wherein most unmethylated cytosines are converted to thymines.</p>\n\n<p>Reads are not &quot;clipped&quot; (no bases are removed). For example, in the case of small RNAs that are shorter than the read-length, there may be adapters flanking these reads&mdash;these adapter sequences remain in the FASTQ file. Some libraries are constructed in a way such that the barcode is read out in the sequence (CSHL small RNAs were made this way during phase II of ENCODE) and will appear in the FASTQ. Even though these barcodes would need to be trimmed off prior to mapping, they are still included in the FASTQ file because different users may choose different trimming algorithms.</p>\n\n<h3>FASTQ sequencing quality</h3>\n\n<p>FASTQ uses four lines for each sequence with the fourth line denoting the sequencing quality in each position. The consortium reports the Phred quality score from 0 to 93 using ASCII 33 to 126, i.e., Phred score plus 33. This is used by the newest versions of the Illumina pipeline, Sanger and SRA. The Phred score of a base[<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a>][<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a>] is defined as -10 log10 (<em>e</em>) where <em>e</em> is the estimated probability for a base to be erroneous.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format\">Introductory information on the FASTQ format</a></p>\n\n<h2><a id=\"bam\" name=\"bam\">BAM</a></h2>\n\n<h3>BAM file content</h3>\n\n<p>When sequence reads are mapped to reference sequences, the resulting alignments are stored in BAM files (SAMtools are used to convert between SAM and BAM files). Mapping algorithms (e.g., Bowtie, BWA, STAR, etc.) use many parameters, such as the version of a reference genome, the total number of mismatches allowed during mapping, the maximal number of times a read is allowed to map to the reference, etc. Furthermore, SAMtools may change the content while converting a SAM file to a BAM file. For example, the user may allow both unique-mapping and multiple-mapping reads during the mapping and then decide to retain only unique-mapping reads in the BAM file. Therefore the consortium documents the parameters used by the mapping algorithm and SAMtools in the header of the BAM files.</p>\n\n<p>For experiments that generate paired-end reads, the paired reads are stored in the same BAM file. The consortium also retains unmapped reads and spike-ins (whenever appropriate). Because spike-in reads are &quot;non-chromosomal&quot;, they need to be filtered out before downstream processing. The quality scores for unmapped reads are stored in the same format as in FASTQ files, i.e., Phred+33. Biological replicates are stored in separate BAM files. Multiple lanes of the same library are pooled into a single BAM, with read names containing lane information so that it is possible to decompose the pooled BAM file into individual BAM files by lane.</p>\n\n<p>At the present time, the consortium only releases one BAM file for each FASTQ file (or for each pair of FASTQ files in the case of paired-end datasets). However in the future the consortium may allow multiple BAM files for the same FASTQ file, potentially for different mapping algorithms (e.g., Bowtie and STAR for RNA-seq data) or for mapping to different reference genomes (e.g., personalized genomes). In that case, the consortium will provide clear guidelines for usage.</p>\n\n<h3>BAM mapping parameters</h3>\n\n<p>Due to the diverse data types used in ENCODE, the choice of mapping algorithms and the parameters used are data type dependent. These parameters include how many mismatches are allowed, whether seed matching is used (only the prefix of each read is used for mapping while the low-quality suffix is discarded), whether reads that map to many locations in the reference are allowed, etc. The consortium aims to specify the settings of these parameters for each individual data type, and these specifications will be released in the future versions of this document. Nonetheless, the settings of all tunable parameters are specified in the header of each BAM file.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAM_format\">Introductory information on the SAM/BAM format</a></p>\n\n<h2><a id=\"bigwig\" name=\"bigwig\">bigWig</a></h2>\n\n<h3>bigWig file content</h3>\n\n<p>In order to visualize the number of reads that are mapped to a reference genome as a continuous signal in the UCSC genome browser, a user can convert a BAM file to a bigWig file (via the intermediate bedGraph format, using computer programs provided by the UCSC Genome Browser).</p>\n\n<p>Stranded data are stored in two bigWig files, one file for the plus genomic strand and the other file for the minus strand. The data on the two strands are displayed as two separate UCSC tracks by default and can also be displayed in different colors as a single overlayed track (without changing the two bigWig files). For unstranded data, signals on the plus and minus strands are summed and only one bigWig file is needed.</p>\n\n<p>Data from biological replicates are stored in individual bigWig files and can be viewed as separate UCSC tracks; however, this may cease to be necessary after the user has concluded that the replicates are highly reproducible. Thus the consortium also provides one bigWig file for each experiment with the reads in all biological replicates pooled and used this file to define the default track for the experiment.</p>\n\n<h3>Generation of bigWig files</h3>\n\n<p>To facilitate the comparison across datasets, ENCODE bigWig files are automatically generated by ENCODE uniform processing pipelines which contain appropriate parameters for data normalization and filtering. The version and key parameters of the pipeline that have been used to generate a bigWig file are provided.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigWig.html\">Introductory information on the bigWig format</a></p>\n\n<h2><a id=\"bigbed\" name=\"bigbed\">bigBed</a></h2>\n\n<h3>bigBed file content</h3>\n\n<p>Analyses of ENCODE data produce annotation files, e.g., genomic regions that are enriched in ChIP-seq signal of transcription factors (ChIP-seq peaks), splice junctions detected using RNA-seq data, or differentially methylated regions detected using bisulfite sequencing data. Such annotation files can be visualized in the UCSC genome browser using the bigBed format. Related to and interconvertible with the text-based Bed format, bigBed is an indexed binary format designed for rapid visualization. For each element in an ENCODE bigBed file, the consortium specifies its chromosome, start, end, genomic strand when applicable, and a color score that denotes average signal enrichment for the region.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigBed.html\">Introductory information on the bigBed format</a></p>\n\n<h2><a id=\"hic\" name=\"hic\">hic</a></h2>\n\n<h3>hic file content</h3>\n\n<p>Proximity mapping assays, like Hi-C, measure long-range chromatin interactions between pairs of loci in the genome. Reads are sequenced and aligned to a reference genome using the juicer and hictools software to generate hic files, which are highly compressed binary files containing the contact matrices and normalization vectors at several different resolutions. These files include annotations of chromatin structural features, including loops, loop anchor motifs, contact domains, and compartments[<a href=\"#ref5\">5</a>]. From the ENCODE portal, hic files are visualized using the Juicebox software. See&nbsp;<a href=\"/experiments/ENCSR545YBD/\">ENCSR545YBD</a> as an example.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Data\">Introductory information on the hic format</a></p>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n\n<p><a id=\"ref1\" name=\"ref1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;Cock PJ, Fields CJ, Goto N, Heuer ML, Rice PM.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=20015970\">The Sanger FASTQ file format for sequences with quality scores, and the Solexa/Illumina FASTQ variants</a>.&nbsp;<em>Nucleic Acids Res</em>. 2010 Apr;38(6):1767-71.

Each object represents a specific component of the assay or analysis. A schema profile for each object type outlines the set of properties for a given object of that type. For example, a patient is represented by a Patient object, the sample collected from a patient is represented by a Biospecimen object. For a complete list of these schemas, click &quot;Materials &amp; Methods&quot; -&gt; &quot;<a href=\"/profiles/?\">Schemas</a>&quot; at the top of any page.</p>\n\n<p>A property for a given object can &ldquo;link&rdquo; or &ldquo;point&rdquo; to another object on the KCE Portal. For example, an Experiment object has the property <em>replicates</em>, a list containing the Replicate objects associated with that assay. The properties of each Replicate object are embedded directly in the experiment JSON. Each Replicate has properties of additional objects embedded within it as well, including the Library, Biosample, and Donor objects associated with that Replicate (Figure 1). These object relationships form the basis of the core data model for the KCE Portal. For details on viewing the JSON of objects on the Portal and accessing properties of objects programmatically, please see the introduction to our <a href=\"/help/rest-api/\">REST API</a>.</p>\n\n<pre style=\"width:50%;margin-left:25%\">\n{\n<font color=\"#4B7EE5\">    replicates:[\n        {\n            biological_replicate_number: 1,\n            status: &quot;released&quot;,</font>\n            <font color=\"#F45128\">library: {\n&nbsp;               nucleic_acid_term_name: &quot;RNA&quot;,\n&nbsp;               size_range: &quot;&gt;200&quot;,</font>\n                <font color=\"#25af29\">biosample: {\n&nbsp;                   </font><font color=\"#25af29\">biosample_ontology: {...},\n&nbsp;                   </font><font color=\"#25af29\">treatments: [...],\n                    </font><font color=\"#FDB232\">donor: {\n&nbsp;                       age: 15,\n&nbsp;                       sex: &quot;female&quot;\n&nbsp;                   }</font>\n                <font color=\"#25af29\">}</font>\n            <font color=\"#F45128\">}</font>\n        <font color=\"#4B7EE5\">},\n        {...}\n    ]</font>\n}\n</pre>\n\n<center>\n<p style=\"font-size:9pt; color:gray\">Figure 1. Embedded properties of an example experiment JSON describing associated replicate, library, biosample, and donor objects.</p>\n</center>\n\n<h3>Accessions</h3>\n\n<p>The KCE creates accessions for metadata that can be reused to ensure that the exact patient or biospecimen is being referred to when being discussed or analyzed. Below are some examples of accessions given to certain types of metadata:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>A biospecimen</strong>: An biospecimen accession refers to a tube or sample of that biological material used in an assay. For example, the following would each be given a biospecimen accession: (1) a batch of a cell line grown on a specific day, (2) the isolation of a primary cell culture on a specific day, or (3) the dissection of a tissue sample on a specific day.</li>\n\t<li><strong>A patient</strong>: Every patient is given a patient accession. This accession allows multiple biospecimens obtained from a single patient to be grouped together. </li>\n\t<li><strong>A library</strong>: Each unique library that can be resequenced is given an accession. This accession ensures the correct files are associated with the nucleic acid material created from the biospecimen.</li>\n\t<li><strong>A file</strong>: Each data file available for download is given an accession. The file accession and file format are included in the name of the file itself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Dependencies and Audits</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In order to ensure metadata accuracy, each schema has a set of dependencies to enforce proper modeling when related metadata are submitted.&nbsp;For example, if a FASTQ file is posted, a dependency requires an additional property indicating whether that file is single-ended or paired-ended. If paired-ended is selected, an additional dependency requires the ID of the paired file is included as well. These safeguards ensure that the appropriate metadata are in place prior to the submission of a new object.</p>\n\n<p>After submission, a system of audits are used to identify inconsistencies in the data. While dependencies enforce metadata <em>within</em> an object, audits typically check metadata <em>between</em> linked objects. For example, these data audits include checks that ensure that a ChIP-seq Experiment lists control Experiments with matching biosample metadata and that spike-ins are used for RNA-seq assays. These audits are also used to communicate details of KCE data, such as data quality relative to standards, to the public. Each audit is designated a color depending on its severity, and is displayed on the search page and individual object pages.</p>\n\n",

                "body": "<p>The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is to build a comprehensive catalog of candidate functional elements in the genome. The catalog includes genes (protein-coding and non-protein coding), transcribed regions, and regulatory elements, as well as information about the tissues, cell types and conditions where they are found to be active. The current phase of ENCODE (2016-2019) greatly expands the number of cell types, data types and assays and includes the study of both the human and mouse genomes.</p>\n\n<p>Like the Human Genome Project, the ENCODE Project seeks rapid data dissemination and use by the entire scientific community. Accordingly, to encourage the widest possible use of the datasets, all data produced will be available for unrestricted use immediately upon release to public databases, eliminating the nine-month moratorium&nbsp;used previously in earlier phases of&nbsp;ENCODE. For guidelines&nbsp;on how to cite ENCODE data in your publications, please visit the <a href=\"/help/citing-encode\">Citing ENCODE</a> page.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Software and Analysis Release Policy for ENCODE Consortium Members</strong></h3>\n\n<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>\n\n<p>The ENCODE Project aims to enhance biomedical research by generating community resources of genomics data, software, tools and methods for genomics data analysis, and products resulting from data analyses and interpretations.</p>\n\n<p>As outlined in the ENCODE FOAs, NHGRI expects that the major resources resulting from this project, including data, software, and analyses, generated by the ENCODE awards will be made freely available to the research community. Timely release of software and analyses is a central part of ENCODE&rsquo;s mission, to help to maximize the value of our work in the broader community, and enhance the reproducibility of our research.</p>\n\n<p>We hope that the tools, methods, and standards developed by ENCODE will continue to have a lasting impact on the field. In particular, the software produced by ENCODE is likely to be an important legacy of the project. Software packages are often important community contributions, and may be extremely widely used and highly cited. Thus we strongly encourage ENCODE-funded labs to provide useable, documented software and associated publications, for the mutual benefit of the publishing labs and the consortium.</p>\n\n<p>This document outlines policy for software and analysis release for ENCODE-funded research by all members of the ENCODE Consortium.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Software </strong></h4>\n\n<p>Developers of significant new ENCODE-related software will make their programs, including source code, freely available. Examples include data processing pipelines and implementations of statistical, visualization, and modeling tools developed to process or analyze ENCODE data.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong><em>What to release: </em></strong>ENCODE <strong><em>requires </em></strong>the release of analysis pipelines used for major ENCODE products such as the ENCODE Encyclopedia. ENCODE <strong><em>strongly encourages </em></strong>release of software tools and pipelines used for major analyses in planned ENCODE publications, and other software likely to be useful to multiple groups either within ENCODE or in the broader community.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>When to release software: </em></strong>The decision of when software should be released should balance the benefit to the community against the labor involved in software release and maintenance. Major software tools should be released as soon as they are sufficiently stable, and no later than the time they are first used in publications.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>How to release software: </em></strong>Software should be released by version controlled public repositories (e.g Github). These repositories should be linked via the ENCODE DCC. Software should be well-documented and there should be a contact person for questions. Software development should continue through version-controlled deposition, and the software version used to generate each dataset should be documented.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>Accompanying publications: </em></strong>In addition to the release of well-documented code, we strongly encourage developers to publish citable descriptions of their software. We recommend that authors describe their software in methodological papers so that they can receive credit for their work. These can be published in conventional journals, and/or disseminated pre-publication through pre-print servers (e.g. bioRxiv).&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>Dissemination of more complex pipelines. </em></strong>For most complex analyses, multiple software components are routinely combined to generate intermediate datasets. For reproducibility of these results, analysts should document all software components used, and the specific software versions utilized. We encourage (1) documenting these components; (2) providing scripts that reproduce key figures in ENCODE publications; (3) establishing reusable, publicly accessible analysis pipelines (e.g. Galaxy, virtual machines, Docker, DNA Nexus sessions); and (4) linking these through the DCC website.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>Current and Future Support for Released Software:</em></strong> Software that will be released for publication and to repositories (e.g., Github) should state the types and degree of support users can expect for them to download, run and troubleshoot the available software as well as whether or not updates and &ldquo;fixes&rdquo; should be expected.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<h4><strong>Dissemination of Intermediate Data Analysis Results </strong></h4>\n\n<p>All analysis results and data analysis products generated by the ENCODE consortium that will be of broad use to the community must be registered at the DCC under unique accession numbers as soon as they are stable, and certainly no later than the time of manuscript acceptance.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What to release</em></strong>. Examples of types of analysis results to be released include:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Elements in the ENCODE Encyclopedia</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Other major maps of gene regulatory elements, key genomic features or predictions, and gene regulatory network models.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. Other analyses that are significant elements of planned publications.</p>\n\n<p>When possible, analysis results should be released using standard ENCODE <a href=\"/help/file-formats/\">file formats</a>. Analyses comprising major ENCODE deliverables (e.g. the Encyclopedia) may be subject to pre-release vetting by consortium members.</p>\n\n<p>Analyses should be released in an unrestricted manner via the DCC when they are free of personally identifiable information (to current standards). When IRB rules apply, analysis products should be release via controlled access (such as dbGaP) using the appropriate sharing mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>Analyses should be accompanied by written documentation, ideally in the form of a publication or a pre-print (e.g. bioRxiv), with clearly specified contact author. The release should specify and provide links to: (1) the datasets used, (2) the software used and the specific version, and (3) the specific pipelines used and their specific versions.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Good Software Design Practices: </em></strong>We recommend (1) using strict versioning and version control; (2) providing easy installation and compilation steps; (3) including simple test input datasets with matched output, and small unit tests for software with multiple components; (4) including realistic &ldquo;production&rdquo; tests, possibly matching publication figures; (5) specifying any unusual hardware requirements (e.g. CPU, RAM, disk).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated as of January 9, 2019</strong></em></p>\n"

Through analyses of tumor samples from patients enrolled in a clinical trial of a first-in-class HIF-2 inhibitor (PT2385), Kevin Courtney, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues report the identification of an acquired resistance mutation that developed in the HIF-2α protein in response to the drug. The mutation reveals a fundamental dependency of kidney cancer on HIF-2. The finding is a telling indicator that other strategies targeting HIF-2 are likely to be effective in treating kidney cancer.</p>"

The findings, published in EBioMedicine, represent the first comprehensive catalog of ccRCC, the most common type of kidney cancer. By applying mathematical models and a co-occurring matrix with superimposed vectorial processes based on tumor size and grade, investigators developed the first morphology-driven evolutionary model of the disease. <a href=\"https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2019/catalog-map-kidney-cancer-tumors.html\">Press Release</a>"

Through analyses of tumor samples from patients enrolled in a clinical trial of a first-in-class HIF-2 inhibitor (PT2385), Kevin Courtney, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues report the identification of an acquired resistance mutation that developed in the HIF-2α protein in response to the drug. The mutation reveals a fundamental dependency of kidney cancer on HIF-2. The finding is a telling indicator that other strategies targeting HIF-2 are likely to be effective in treating kidney cancer."

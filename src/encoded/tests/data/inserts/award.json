        "description": "Genomes perform several critical tasks to ensure normal development, homeostasis and health. First, gene transcription needs to be accurately regulated and defects in gene regulation can result in human diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Second, chromosomes need to be replicated and then accurately and reliably transmitted to daughter cells. Chromosome segregation requires extensive chromosome compaction. Defects in this process can lead to genome instability, aneuploidy and cancer. Recent studies have revealed that the spatial organization of chromosomes is a major factor in controlling both gene expression and chromosome segregation. The work proposed here will for the first time characterize the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of chromosomes during different stages of the cell cycle at unprecedented resolution which will allow the identification of cis-elements involved in the 3D folding of chromosomes. A set of novel and powerful genomic technologies (5C and Hi-C) that allow the mapping of 3D chromosome folding will be applied to the study of the human genome. These technologies will be combined with the use of synchronous cell populations and genome-wide analysis of regulatory elements to characterize the different chromosome conformations during the cell cycle and to identify the cis-elements and some trans-factors involved. In addition, the processes that determine 3D folding of the genome, such as transcription and modulation of DNA topology will be studied. This project will provide answers to long-standing questions related to long-range gene regulation, chromosome segregation, the epigenetic transmission of transcription profiles to daughter cells, and the still largely mysterious process of formation of compact metaphase chromosomes.",

        "description": "Temporal and tissue-specific gene expression in mammals depends on complex interactions between transcriptional regulatory proteins and cis-elements such as promoter, enhancers and insulators. Previous large-scale efforts have produced an excellent catalog of transcriptional start sites for most mammalian genes but the mechanisms that control the activation of each promoter in specific cell types remains largely Unknown. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of tissue- and cell type-specific gene expression, it is important to characterize the activities of each promoter in specific cell types, and identify the cis-regulatory elements including enhancers and insulators for each gene. Here, we propose to use the laboratory mouse as a model system and conduct genome-wide analysis of active promoters, enhancers and insulator elements in a panel of embryonic and adult tissues with medical relevance. Specifically, we will (1) identify the active promoters in the mouse genome in a representative set of embryonic and adult tissues; (2) identify potential enhancers and insulator elements in the mouse genome in the same embryonic and adult tissues; (3) identify and characterize tissue-specific promoters and enhancers in the mouse genome; and (4) validate the function of a select set of identified promoters and enhancers. The proposed study, if completed, will result in a comprehensive map of promoters, potential enhancers and insulators throughout the mouse genome. The resource will provide a foundation for analyzing the gene regulatory networks in the mouse cells, and guide the functional annotation of the mouse genome. The results will also help understand the evolution of cis-regulatory sequences, when compared to similar results to be made available as the human ENCODE project progresses. The laboratory mouse represents an important model system for understanding human biology and the molecular basis of human diseases. As a reference to the human genome, the mouse genome sequence has proved extremely valuable in gene annotation. The utility of the laboratory mouse as a model system is currently limited by the lack of understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms that control both common and species-specific gene expression programs in mouse cells. In this project, we propose to define the set of genomic sequences known as cis-regulatory elements in the mouse genome. These regulatory DNA consists of promoters, enhancers, insulators and other regulatory sequences. As a key step towards understanding the gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, we will produce a comprehensive map of promoters, enhancers and insulators in the mouse genome. We will use a newly developed, high throughput experimental strategy to identify these sequences that are engaged in gene activation in the mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic fibroblasts, and a panel of embryonic and adult tissues. We will identify tissue specific promoters and enhancers, and characterize the regulatory mechanisms that control the gene expression programs in the specific tissues. Completion of the proposed research is expected to improve our knowledge of the gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, and provide a reference for understanding the same process in human beings.",

        "description": "Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on \"Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome.\" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes. Individual susceptibility to disease is determined in part by genetics, and we can map with high precision the locations of DNA variants associated with disease susceptibility. In order to understand how these variants contribute to disease susceptibility, we need to identify the biological functions of all DNA sequences; the proposed work will help us map these functional DNA sequences.",

The ENCODE project has focused its initial attention on two cell lines, 1) K562 cells, a myeloid precursor cell line and 2) GM12878, a lymphoblastoid cell line, and our laboratory has mapped the binding sites of a large number of transcription factor expressed in these cells. To study their conservation and help provide functional information into these binding sites and to determine if these sites are occupied in vivo, we propose two types of studies. First, we will map the binding sites of at least 30 transcription factor orthologs that have been analyzed in the human ENCODE project in mouse MEL and CH12 cells which are analogous to K562 and GM12878 cells, respectively. Second, we will map the binding sites of Pol II and nine other factors in cells differentiated from human CD34+ cells and primary erythroid mouse cells. These studies will determine which transcription factor binding sites and gene targets are conserved in vertebrates and which are species-specific as well as determine the extent to which targets mapped in cultured cell lines reflect in vivo binding sites. The information from these studies will be deposited into public databases and is expected to be extremely valuable to the large mouse and human genetic communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ENCODE project has produced relatively large amounts of data on transcription factor binding and RNA expression in a limited number of human cell lines. We propose to extend these results by obtaining mouse cell lines at similar states of differentiation to human cell lines. We will then duplicate the experiments that have been done in human cells, and locate control elements based on sequence conservation and similarities in factor binding between the two species. We will also determine if elements identified in vitro are occupied in cells isolated from organisms.",

Digital DNaseI technology enables efficient genome-wide mapping of accessible chromatin and DNaseI hypersensitive sites. The core regions of DNaseI hypersensitive sites are constitutively populated by regulatory factor binding sites, the nucleotide-resolution footprints of which may be systematically exposed on a genome-wide scale by ultra-deep sequencing. DNaseI hypersensitive sites exhibit marked cell-type variability; accordingly, production of a comprehensive catalog will require surveying a wide range of cell types. Cell types targeted under this proposal include murine analogues of the ENCODE Tier 1 and Tier 2 common reference cell lines; a broad spectrum of primary adult tissues; embryonic stem cells; and sentinel tissues amenable to sequential temporal profiling during development. The production of a parallel, high-quality, high-resolution compendium of mouse regulatory DNA will greatly enhance the value of the human ENCODE project and will provide a rich independent and unique resource for evolutionary, functional, and model organism genomics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance to Public Health Understanding the genetic basis of human disease requires detailed knowledge of the functional elements of the human genome which may be subject to polymorphism. The ENCODE Project seeks to identify all of the functional elements in the human genome, and present project seeks to greatly increase the value of the ENCODE data by providing a parallel catalogue of regulatory DNA in the mouse genome. This project is therefore expected to provide key insights into the importance of elements in the human genome, and to provide an unprecedented resource for rational functional modeling of human disease in the mouse.",

        "description": "The Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers (REMC) will aim to transform our understanding of human epigenetics through production and integrative analysis of comprehensive reference epigenomes for ES cells, differentiated cells and tissues. In pursuit of this goal, we have assembled a unique scientific team and infrastructure with broad expertise and capabilities in stem cell biology, epigenomics, technology, production research and computation. We recently demonstrated two complementary methods that leverage ultra high-throughput sequencing for epigenomic analysis. In the first method, genome-wide chromatin maps are acquired by deep sequencing chromatin IP DNA (ChlP-Seq). In the second, nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps are generated by high-throughput bisulfite-sequencing (HTBS). These methods represent major improvements over prior tools as they yield precise digital information, have high genome coverage, require fewer cells and are cost-effective. Multiple epigenomic maps have already been produced for stem cells and primary tissues, and pipelines have been assembled for efficient data collection, processing and analysis. For the REMC project, we propose to apply ChlP-Seq and HTBS pipelines to generate comprehensive high-resolution maps of chromatin state and DNA methylation for 100 diverse cell types. Cell types were selected for their biological and medical importance, and for their potential to maximize the comprehensiveness of acquired epigenomic data. They include human ES cells, ES-derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells, reprogrammed stem cells and primary tissues. ChlP-Seq will be used to map highly informative chromatin modifications and related chromatin proteins in each cell type. HTBS will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps. Reference epigenomes will reveal the locations and activation states of diverse functional genomic elements, inform on the developmental state and potential of studied cell populations, and provide a framework for understanding complex epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. All data will be made available to the scientific community upon verification. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive characterization of epigenetic marks ('the epigenome') is a critical step towards a global understanding of the human genome in health and disease. The proposed mapping studies will provide unprecedented views of the human epigenetic landscape and its variation across cell states, offer fundamental insight into the functions and interrelationships of epigenetic marks, and provide a framework for future studies of normal and diseased epigenomes.",

The Center integrates this capacity with an existing high-throughput genomics and informatics infrastructure operating at scale, creating unique synergies that enable genome-scale epigenetic analyses of high-value human primary and progenitor cell types. The Center will perform high-resolution, whole-genome profiling of foundational epigenotypes in project cell types including high-resolution quantification of chromatin structural remodeling, and analysis of DNA methylation at both actively remodeled and silenced regulatory DNA templates. The Center will also profile both small RNA species and conventional gene expression from all study cell types.

In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps.

Fundamental to understanding human biology and disease is the ability to identify and locate the functional elements in the human genome sequence.

Based on the empirically determined characteristics of the detected transcripts uncovered in this proposal, a classification system for transcribed protein coding and non-protein coding portions of the human transcriptome will be established. Our aims include first to generate a comprehensive set of subcellular compartment-specific long (>200 nucleotides, nts) and short (<200 nts) polyadenylated (polyA+) and non-polyadenylated (polyA-) RNA samples from each of the cell types studied. These RNA samples will be analyzed using: a) high density tiling arrays (5 nucleotides [nt] interrogation resolution for long and short RNAs), b) sequencing (pyrosequencing [454] and clonal single molecule sequencing for short RNAs [Solexa]), c) sequenced paired-end ditags (PETs) for 5' TSS and 3' termination locations for polyA+ transcripts and d) sequenced cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) tags for 5' TSS of polyA- RNAs. Characterization of full length subcellular compartment-specific transcripts will also be carried out using: 1) a combination of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), RT-PCR and sequencing, 2) RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and 3) in situ immunohistochemistry. These characterization steps will provide additional information concerning the annotated and unannotated RNAs found to be associated with known functional, compartment-specific proteins and their localization in subcellular organelles of known function. The research and health-care community are well positioned to take advantage of a detailed catalog of classified transcribed regions in the human genome. For example, the identification of millions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and the ability to genetically alter specific transcript expression by small inhibitory (si-) and micro (mi-) RNAs are highly useful for the molecular characterization of diseases associated with the transcribed regions. However, the utility of these and other genomic resources are dependent upon having a complete and high quality catalogue of transcribed regions.",

        "description": "Mapping regulatory information throughout the human genome is essential for both determining the function of the human genome and for understanding human development and disease. We propose to establish a high throughput production facility to identify the DNA binding sites for transcription factors and chromatin modifying proteins in human cells. Transcription factor targets, chromatin modifications and modifying enzymes will be mapped across the genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. This binding information will be validated and analyzed to ensure that it is of high quality and then compared to other genomic annotations. Our three aims are: 1) To establish a production facility for mapping targets of transcription factors. The pipeline will consist of five components: a) cell preparation, b) antibody validation and chromatin immunoprecipitation, c) DNA target analysis, d) target validation and e) sample tracking and databases. 2) To use the pipeline to map targets of 600 transcription factors, chromatin modifications and chromatin modifying enzymes in at least two major cell lines (HeLa S3 and HepG2), and targets of other factors in additional cell lines. 3) To maintain our results in a database and also make them accessible through public databases. We will interrelate our genomic annotations with those determined by other groups (particularly those from the ENCODE consortium), focusing on correlating patterns of transcription-factor binding and chromatin modifications with gene expression. We expect this project to contribute significant information to the identification of regulatory and functional elements in the human genome.",

        "description": "The goal of this proposal is to identify at high resolution all active gene regulatory elements in the human genome among cell types representative of most human tissues. We will accomplish this goal by identifying regions of open chromatin with two independent and complementary methods: DNasel hypersensitivity and Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE), combined with single-nucleosome mapping and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for selected regulatory factors. The immediate benefit of success will be a high-quality public atlas of the human DNA regulatory elements that are likely to be active in each cell type. Identification of open chromatin regions has been one of the most accurate and robust methods to identify functional promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions in mammalian cells. A principal advantage of an open chromatin approach is that all potential sites in the genome are simultaneously assayed in an unbiased manner. DNasel hypersensitivity and FAIRE interrogate chromatin by entirely different underlying mechanisms, and therefore represent independent, cross-validating assessments of chromatin state. In addition, we will perform single-nucleosome mapping in selected cell types as an independent direct biochemical verification of open chromatin regions. For a selected subset of cell-types, we will further annotate open chromatin regions with respect to their biological activity by determining the binding location of proteins that mark transcription start sites, transcriptional units, insulators, or have broad regulatory function. The Aims of this proposal are 1) to identify all regions of open chromatin in 40 cell types by DNasel and FAIRE analyses, and 2) determine the biological function of open chromatin regions by ChIP and nucleosome mapping. To accomplish these Aims, we have assembled a team of five researchers who are leaders in their respective fields and who have contributed significantly to the ENCODE pilot project. Furthermore, we have developed a streamlined pipeline, which has been used to generate high quality whole-genome data from a number of cell types.",

In this application, we propose to undertake a large-scale project to map the genomewide locations of >35 histone modifications and related proteins in >20 human cell types by coupling chromatin IP with massive-throughput sequencing on the Solexa platform. Our preliminary data demonstrate that this approach is highly accurate and a major advance over existing technologies in terms of cell requirements, genome coverage, throughput and cost-effectiveness. A sequencing pipeline will be applied to generate more than 500 genomewide datasets of chromatin structure by sequencing >1000 samples. A computational pipeline will then convert the sequencing reads into high resolution, genomewide maps that can be visualized in genome browsers and used for downstream analysis. Comparative genomic analysis and motif-finding tools will be applied to classify genomic sites based on associated chromatin structures and to identify underlying sequence determinants. Cell and molecular biology methods will be used to validate inferred functions for a representative subset of discovered elements. Chromatin regulation is extensively implicated in many aspects of human development and disease. In particular, cancer cells may universally exhibit aberrant chromatin states. The proposed systematic identification and characterization of chromatin regulatory elements in the human genome will offer unprecedented insight into the structure and function of chromatin, and provide an invaluable resource for investigators in chromatin, genomics, cancer and many other fields of research.

The pilot ENCODE project sought to develop and test a variety of experimental, computational and analytical platforms to determine the best ways to approach this problem by focusing on a defined 1% of the human genome. During this initial phase of ENCODE, the applicants of this proposal developed robust high-throughput methods for detecting and validating functional transcription promoters, DNA methylation patterns, and transcription factor occupancy in the pilot regions, and demonstrated that these approaches can be scaled fully to the entire human genome with high robustness, sensitivity and specificity. These experiences, together with the resulting technology and analysis platforms and an existing, highly productive infrastructure, lead to this response to NHGRI's RFA-HG-07-030. This application presents an ambitious proposal to expand a program to map and functionally annotate cis-regulatory sequences of the human genome. The plan emphasizes full genome-comprehensivity for three experimental pipelines.: 1) a new sequence-based method called ChlPSeq to elucidate more than 600 comprehensive transcription factor:DNA interactomes; 2) a similar new method called MethSeq to determine the methylation status of all the CpG-rich regions in the human genome in more than 1,000 human cell types and cell states; and 3) a high throughput transfection assay pipeline to measure transcriptional activities of 25,000 human \"promoter-plus\" proximal cis-regulatory domains, including at least one major promoter for each of the annotated protein-coding genes. A second major product of the promoter pipeline will be a physical resource of proximate reporter constructs for all human genes, designed to accommodate future fine-structure dissection of the promoter regulatory motifs and testing of long-distance elements. All of the experimental work in this project will be subjected to analysis with appropriate quality metrics. In addition, comparative genomics and other computational analyses will be integrated with the experimental production to help prioritize and shape input to the pipelines and to capture information in forms useful to both biologists and genomicists. These analyses will produce several large-scale deliverables, including hundreds of ChIP data-driven sequence motif models, some of which additionally leverage evolutionary conservation for each of hundreds of transcription factors.",

Comprehensive identification and characterization of functional DNA elements is thus an essential goal with major implications for human health. Genomic DNA is organized into chromatin, a higher-order structure composed of DNA, RNA and proteins. Chromatin mapping technologies have emerged as a powerful means for identifying functional DNA elements, which are associated with characteristic chromatin structures. Mapping has enabled the systematic annotation of diverse types of functional elements, including promoters, enhancers and silencers, and new discoveries related to chromatin organization and genome regulation in health and disease. The proposed ENCODE data production center aims to vastly expand the catalog of functional elements in the human genome through production mapping of Protein, DNA and RNA constituents of chromatin. High-throughput pipelines will be used to map histone modifications, chromatin regulatory proteins and non-coding RNA binding interactions. These pipelines will be applied to designated ENCODE cell lines, embryonic stem (ES) cells and derivatives, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and phenotypically diverse human tissues. Key histone modifications will also be mapped in representative cell and tissue types from multiple individuals, in order to address the extent and significance of inter-individual variation in chromatin landscapes and their relationships to genetic background. These multi-dimensional datasets will be integrated through innovative computational algorithms to identify sequences, motifs, variants and regulatory interactions that dictate chromatin state and functional element activity. Thus, the proposed project will dramatically increase the number, resolution and precision of functional DNA elements in the ENCODE catalog, and explicitly define causal sequences and physical interactions that mediate chromatin states and regulation in the human genome. All data will be rapidly released and made freely available to the scientific community.",

        "description": "Complete annotation of all functional sequences in the human genome remains a major challenge a decade after its initial sequencing. This pertains in particular to gene regulatory elements, many of which are located far away from their target genes, but play fundamental roles in human biology. Significant progress towards annotation of the gene regulatory architecture has been made in recent years predominantly using cultured human cells. However, large-scale studies in mice, as well as anecdotal examples identified in human studies, have indicated the existence of large populations of gene regulatory sequences with very restricted temporal and tissue-specific activity during mammalian development. Despite their critical importance in human development and disease, this set of regulatory sequences will likely be missed by approaches restricted to cell lines or adult tissues. To fill this gap, the major objective for this U54 application is to generate catalogs of developmentally active gene regulatory sequences using existing high throughput data production pipelines for genomic approaches including ChlP-Seq, MethylC-Seq and RNA-Seq on embryonic tissues. Performing such studies directly on human tissues is not feasible due to limited availability of human embryos at relevant stages of development. We will therefore in this study exploit the laboratory mouse, a widely used animal model that shares a similar embryonic developmental program and gene regulatory architecture with humans. In addition to embryonic development, our studies will also generate a complementary reference dataset from postnatal and adult mice to better understand the dynamics of gene regulation over time. Furthermore, we will assess the biological authenticity of identified regulatory sequences by in-depth functional validation using an established transgenic mouse pipeline. It is anticipated that generation of these datasets will fill a major void in the functional annotation o a mammalian genome and help to complete the catalog of gene regulatory sequences in the human genome.",

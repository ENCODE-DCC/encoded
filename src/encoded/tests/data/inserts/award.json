        "description": "The Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers (REMC) will aim to transform our understanding of human epigenetics through production and integrative analysis of comprehensive reference epigenomes for ES cells, differentiated cells and tissues. In pursuit of this goal, we have assembled a unique scientific team and infrastructure with broad expertise and capabilities in stem cell biology, epigenomics, technology, production research and computation. We recently demonstrated two complementary methods that leverage ultra high-throughput sequencing for epigenomic analysis. In the first method, genome-wide chromatin maps are acquired by deep sequencing chromatin IP DNA (ChlP-Seq). In the second, nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps are generated by high-throughput bisulfite-sequencing (HTBS). These methods represent major improvements over prior tools as they yield precise digital information, have high genome coverage, require fewer cells and are cost-effective. Multiple epigenomic maps have already been produced for stem cells and primary tissues, and pipelines have been assembled for efficient data collection, processing and analysis. For the REMC project, we propose to apply ChlP-Seq and HTBS pipelines to generate comprehensive high-resolution maps of chromatin state and DNA methylation for 100 diverse cell types. Cell types were selected for their biological and medical importance, and for their potential to maximize the comprehensiveness of acquired epigenomic data. They include human ES cells, ES-derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells, reprogrammed stem cells and primary tissues. ChlP-Seq will be used to map highly informative chromatin modifications and related chromatin proteins in each cell type. HTBS will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps. Reference epigenomes will reveal the locations and activation states of diverse functional genomic elements, inform on the developmental state and potential of studied cell populations, and provide a framework for understanding complex epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. All data will be made available to the scientific community upon verification. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive characterization of epigenetic marks ('the epigenome') is a critical step towards a global understanding of the human genome in health and disease. The proposed mapping studies will provide unprecedented views of the human epigenetic landscape and its variation across cell states, offer fundamental insight into the functions and interrelationships of epigenetic marks, and provide a framework for future studies of normal and diseased epigenomes.",

The ENCODE Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via experimental assays with laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover how chromosomal elements function together to define the human cell. The DCC's participation enhances the data created by these laboratories through the creation of structured pipelines for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created by the previous ENCODE projects as well as data from the modENCODE project and any other large data collections that are determined to be appropriate for incorporation, the DCC will construct a state of the art data storage repository called the Big Data Hub. The DCC will design and development new software to enhance the data submission and processing pipeline, the organization and access to metadata and the Big Data Hub. In addition, we will create the ENCODE Portal that will be the primary entry point to the wealth of experimentally determined information as well as results of computational analyses. The Portal will integrate these data resources and make them available via enhanced search and browsing capabilities. Tools will be implemented to aid discovery by both experienced bioinformaticians and naive laboratory staff. The DCC will evolve into a substantial service organization allowing biomedical research to take full advance of the ENCODE results. To this end the DCC will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations. The DCC, DAC, and AWG will be tightly woven together to create the EDCAC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this work for public health is that the comprehensive determination of functional elements encoded by the human genome is essential for understanding the nature of human health and the treatment of disease.",

        "description": "The human genome is regulated by hundreds of thousands of functional DNA elements that play pivotal roles in development and disease, yet remain poorly understood. Comprehensive identification and characterization of functional DNA elements is thus an essential goal with major implications for human health. Genomic DNA is organized into chromatin, a higher-order structure composed of DNA, RNA and proteins. Chromatin mapping technologies have emerged as a powerful means for identifying functional DNA elements, which are associated with characteristic chromatin structures. Mapping has enabled the systematic annotation of diverse types of functional elements, including promoters, enhancers and silencers, and new discoveries related to chromatin organization and genome regulation in health and disease. The proposed ENCODE data production center aims to vastly expand the catalog of functional elements in the human genome through production mapping of Protein, DNA and RNA constituents of chromatin. High-throughput pipelines will be used to map histone modifications, chromatin regulatory proteins and non-coding RNA binding interactions. These pipelines will be applied to designated ENCODE cell lines, embryonic stem (ES) cells and derivatives, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and phenotypically diverse human tissues. Key histone modifications will also be mapped in representative cell and tissue types from multiple individuals, in order to address the extent and significance of inter-individual variation in chromatin landscapes and their relationships to genetic background. These multi-dimensional datasets will be integrated through innovative computational algorithms to identify sequences, motifs, variants and regulatory interactions that dictate chromatin state and functional element activity. Thus, the proposed project will dramatically increase the number, resolution and precision of functional DNA elements in the ENCODE catalog, and explicitly define causal sequences and physical interactions that mediate chromatin states and regulation in the human genome. All data will be rapidly released and made freely available to the scientific community.",

        "description": "Complete annotation of all functional sequences in the human genome remains a major challenge a decade after its initial sequencing. This pertains in particular to gene regulatory elements, many of which are located far away from their target genes, but play fundamental roles in human biology. Significant progress towards annotation of the gene regulatory architecture has been made in recent years predominantly using cultured human cells. However, large-scale studies in mice, as well as anecdotal examples identified in human studies, have indicated the existence of large populations of gene regulatory sequences with very restricted temporal and tissue-specific activity during mammalian development. Despite their critical importance in human development and disease, this set of regulatory sequences will likely be missed by approaches restricted to cell lines or adult tissues. To fill this gap, the major objective for this U54 application is to generate catalogs of developmentally active gene regulatory sequences using existing high throughput data production pipelines for genomic approaches including ChlP-Seq, MethylC-Seq and RNA-Seq on embryonic tissues. Performing such studies directly on human tissues is not feasible due to limited availability of human embryos at relevant stages of development. We will therefore in this study exploit the laboratory mouse, a widely used animal model that shares a similar embryonic developmental program and gene regulatory architecture with humans. In addition to embryonic development, our studies will also generate a complementary reference dataset from postnatal and adult mice to better understand the dynamics of gene regulation over time. Furthermore, we will assess the biological authenticity of identified regulatory sequences by in-depth functional validation using an established transgenic mouse pipeline. It is anticipated that generation of these datasets will fill a major void in the functional annotation o a mammalian genome and help to complete the catalog of gene regulatory sequences in the human genome.",

This means discovering and mapping all parts of all genes, including exons, introns, promoters and cis-regulatory sequences, in previous phases of the ENCODE Project, the applicants of this proposal developed and applied robust, high-throughput, genome-wide methods for determining transcription factor occupancy, assessing DNA methylation, identifying RNA transcripts, and experimentally testing candidate regulatory elements and mutations. The combination of experiences from the previous phases with the resulting technology and analysis platforms and the existing, highly productive infrastructure of the applicants form the basis of this response to NHGRI's RFA-HG-11-024 (\"Expanding the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) in the Human and Model Organisms\"). This application presents an ambitious proposal to expand the biological dimensions of ENCODE to include essentially all transcription factors for measurements of occupancy and to produce transcriptomes from hundreds of very specific cell types, and even single cells. The specific plan is to: 1) determine genome wide occupancy for all transcription factors and major cofactors with high resolution in two or more cell types; 2) map and quantify all messenger RNA transcripts, microRNAs and other non-ribosomal RNAs in more than 300 well-defined, uncultured cell types; 3) map DNA methylation state genome-wide at nucleotide resolution in more than 300 cell types; and 4) apply a high-throughput transient transfection assay system to test the impact of -2,000 candidate regulatory elements on gene regulation. All experimental work in this project will be evaluated by appropriate quality metrics, and after quality control, all data will be rapidly deposited in publi, freely accessible genome databases. In addition, computational analyses, including evaluation of comparative and population genomics data, will be integrated with the experimental production to help ensure quality and to capture information in forms useful to biologists, genomicists, and medical researchers. Completion of these Specific Aims will enable biomedical researchers to better and more rapidly understand the consequences of mutations in genomic disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and almost ail common diseases and, therefore, to more fully realize the potential of genomics to impact human health.",

From each sample analyzed, we propose to isolate long (>200 nucleotides) and short (< 200 nucleotides) RNA in biological duplicate. Illumina-based maps for these samples will initially be generated using (1) RNA sequencing (-seq) of ribosomal (r-)RNA depleted long total RNA. (2) RNA-seq of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) pre-treated short RNA (3) Pair-end Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (PE-CAGE) of total RNA. Additionally, for a subset of primary cell lines we will generate the above libraries from nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular fractions. Long RNA-Seq data will be distilled down into functional elements consisting of splice junctions, polyadenylatio sites and de novo genes and transcripts. The short RNA data will be distilled into contigs representing the 5' ends of short RNAs up to the read length. PE-CAGE data will be analyzed to form clusters representing the 5' ends of transcripts linked to a tag internal to the transcript body. Importantly, each element will be assessed for reproducibility using a nonparametric Irreproducible Detection Rate (nplDR) script. Collectively, these data will allow for the detection of novel transcribed regions and supportive information as to the location of promoter regions and subcellular residence of transcripts. In aggregate, these data will be used to generate models of both noncoding and protein coding transcripts and to distinguish isoforms at complex loci necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of mammalian transcriptomes. For a subset of these samples we will simultaneously collect the genome sequence of the human donors to provide a reference map that will be used to map the RNA data against and derive information concerning allele-specific expression and RNA editing. Unannotated transcript models will be tested using long-range (PacBio/454) sequencing. Lastly, proteogenomic analysis will be done and the results compared against the unannotated transcripts.",

To do this, we will generate stable HeLa-S3 and GM 12878 cell lines expressing epitope-tagged RBPs and determine the sub cellular localization pattern of each RBP. These cells will be used to perform CLIP-Seq assays to define genome-wide, and at single-nucleotide resolution, the RNA sequence elements recognized by 250 RBPs. The RNA sequence elements identified will be validated using sequence-based in vitro binding assays. Furthermore, ChlP-Seq will be performed for all nuclear localized RBPs to determine the regions of the genome and chromatin that each RBP associates with. These binding assays will be supplemented with functional assays in RBP-depleted cells that will be critical for assigning functions to the identified binding sites. These assays include RNA-Seq of total cellular RNA and RNA purified from various cellular fractions, ribosomal footprint profiling, and Gro-Seq. Together, these assays will provide functional information regarding the roles of each RBP in splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, RNA stability, RNA editing, translation, RNA localization, and transcription. Bioinformatic analysis will be performed, largely using software generated by our group, to quantitate all assays and to associate functions to the sequence elements identified in the binding assays. Together, these experiments will provide a comprehensive and in depth measure of the functions of approximately half of the human RBPs and the functional sequence elements that they interact with. This project will fill a major gap in the catalog of functional elements encoded in the human genome that are being characterized by the ENCODE consortium.

Since DNasel hypersensitive sites are generic markers of a broad spectrum of human cis-regulatory sequences, the utility of the catalogue will be greatly enhanced by the classification of DHSs into major functional categories including promoters, distal elements (enhancers, LCRs), and insulators.

In the initial modENCODE project, an experimental pipeline was developed and applied to -100 TFs in each organism. In this intervening year, we expect to capture data for another 75-100 factors. The present project builds on the advances made by the groups in the initial phase and also combines the production pipelines to increase efficiency and to realize economies of scale. With these improvements, we will generate data sets for another 400 factors from each organism, which when combined with previous work will represent the bulk of all transcription factors in these key model organisms. For both organisms, the overall strategy tags transcription factor genes by fusion with an enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) sequence through recombineering of large insert clones, and introducing the tagged genes into the genome by transgenesis. ChlP-seq using a high quality anti-GFP antibody is performed on the developmental stage(s) with maximal GFP expression, as guided by available RNA-seq expression data. The aligned sequence reads are analyzed to identify candidate binding sites and likely target genes. We will prioritize TFs with human homologs to maximize the broader utility of the data. We will also perform RNAi of 125 TFs in each organism, followed by RNA-seq, to validate called peaks and their assigned target genes. Finally, we will integrate the information for the different data setsto construct regulatory networks implied by the TF binding site data. We will coordinate with ENCODE projects on human TFs, and our data will provide key in vivo and developmental regulatory information that will be essential to delineate both fundamentally conserved as well as human-specific properties of TFs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Insights from the study of the model organisms Drosophila and C. elegans provide the basis for broad understanding of fundamental processes of animal biology. Because many of their genes have clear relatives in humans, these studies have also led directly to improved understanding of human diseases and in some cases to therapies. Similarly, creating a comprehensive understanding of transcription factor binding sites and building regulatory networks in these key model organisms will create the foundation for understanding human regulatory networks both in health and disease.",

While the genome-proximal response to glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is an ideal model system, the methods developed will be applicable to studying any complex regulatory network. The goal of Aim 1 will be to comprehensively characterize the first 12 hours of the GC response using genome-wide methods to quantify expression, TF binding, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, three-dimensional chromatin structure, and the function of regulatory elements. The outcome will be the most comprehensive and coordinated molecular description of a human regulatory network ever produced. All data will be generated with the highest possible quality standards, and will be submitted pre-publication and without restriction into the public domain. Aim 2 will integrate that data into a nonparametric and hierarchical Bayesian model of the GC response network (GCRN). That model will able to produce functional predictions for each individual regulatory element while also generalizing across genes to reveal shared principles of gene regulation. Aim 3 will validate and reduce uncertainty in the model. That will be accomplished by combining statistical experimental design approaches with multiplex genome and epigenome engineering to iteratively and optimally resolve the most uncertain aspects of the model. The outcome will be a validated and predictive model of the GCRN that will be useful to design customized genomic responses. Aim 4 will demonstrate the use of the resulting model through reprogramming the GCRN to minimize the response of genes associated with metabolism while maintaining the response of genes associated with inflammation and immunity. The outcome will be a derived cell line with a custom programmed GC response. That cell line will have immediate use for studying individual aspects of the GC response; and the approach used to design and realize the customized response will have broad implications for the study of other transcriptional response networks. The overall result of this project will be a mechanistic and actionable understanding of the principles through which individual DNA sequences contribute to the GCRN; a general and transferrable multi-scale modeling approach to study any complex regulatory network; and the novel ability to genetically reprogram transcriptional response networks to study their individual components. We anticipate that that outcome will have broad positive impact on both experimental and computational fields of biomedical research.",

        "description": "Although our ability to determine the genome sequence of individuals is becoming facile, our understanding of the function of most of the human genome is limited. Mapping of regulatory information is particularly crucial since most (>85%) common variants associated with human disease lie outside of coding regions. Previous phases of ENCODE have made important contributions to the mapping of regulatory elements across the genome, but there is much more to be acheived, including the mapping of regulatory regions across many more tissues and at the resolution of individual cells as well as determining the exact regulators i.e. transcription factors that bind each region. In our Stanford ENCODE Production Center for Mapping of Regulatory Regions, we plan to use technologies that we have developed to map the binding sites for most transcription factors (TFs) in five major cell lines using chromatin immunoprecipitation of tagged TFs. We will further expand the catalog of regulatory elements by analyzing open chromatin regions in these cell lines and a wide variety of tissues and cell types from both normal and diseased human subjects consented for open access. Finally, we will map open chromatin regions in single cells from these types of biosamples. These studies will greatly expand the catalog of regulatory regions in the human genome. The rapid deposition of data into the ENCODE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will ensure quick public release. We expect the data and cell lines that are generated by this Center will be a valuable resource for the broad scientific community.",

        "description": "Project Summary The proposed project aims to fundamentally advance the ENCODE Consortium's catalog of functional sequence elements in the human genome. ENCODE has already established a seminal resource that is enabling human biology, genetics and disease research. However, progress towards the Consortium's goal of identifying all functional genomic elements has been constrained by modest assay throughput and by the fact that functional elements tend to be exquisitely context-specific, only declaring themselves in specific developmental intervals, in specific disease settings, or in specific cell types obscured by tissue heterogeneity. To overcome these limitations and hasten progress towards ENCODE goals, the proposed project will purify highly specialized cell types from normal human tissues and blood, from tumors and other disease specimens, and from laboratory 'organoid' models that faithfully recapitulate developing brain, kidney or gut. These purified cell types will be applied to a multiplexed pipeline capable of acquiring genome-wide chromatin state maps with unprecedented throughput and low cost. Thousands of maps reflecting different chromatin modifications in different cell types will be integrated to derive a comprehensive set of sequence elements in the human genome, annotated by their predicted functions and cell type-specificities. The project will bring together a diverse team of experts in human biology and development, chromatin biology, genomics, and production research. This scientific team will coordinate closely with other Data Production, Coordination, Analysis and Functional Characterization Centers in the Encode Consortium to assemble a common catalog of the locations and cell type-specific functions of regulatory elements in the human genome. These annotations, and all primary data collected in the project, will be made freely available to the scientific community, with the goal to catalyze biomedical research and advance genomic medicine.",

        "description": "Almost a tenth of human genes code for proteins that interact with chromosomes in the nucleus. Most of these DNA-associated proteins (referred to as DAPs) are involved in regulating the expression of genes, by serving as part of the basic transcriptional machinery, as transcription factors that regulate the spatial and temporal levels of transcription, or as chromatin state regulators. These proteins are key components in biology, as transcriptional regulation underlies fundamental biological processes in organismal development, in determining cell states during differentiation, and in directing physiological responses to the internal and external environment. Thus, comprehensive and detailed assessment of the molecular actions of DAPs, that is, where they interact throughout the human genome, is a fundamental long-term goal of both basic and clinical research. In response to RFA-HG-16-002, “Expanding the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) in the Human and Mouse (UM1)”, this application proposes to use a recently-established \"shovel ready\" pipeline for mapping DAPs in human cell lines that overcomes the very high failure rates of traditional ChIP-seq, a widely- used approach that requires specific antibodies for each factor. The new approach, called CETCh-seq, involves adding an epitope tag at the endogenous locus encoding each protein, and using chromatin immunoprecipitation with a universal antibody against the epitope followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify DAP-DNA associations genome-wide. This production pipeline will be applied to each of 1,244 DAPs that are expressed in a set of human cell lines and have not yet been mapped by ENCODE. During the four-year project, this pipeline will be used to test each of these factors in one human cell line, and for 100 of the DAPs, in four human cell lines, allowing characterization of cell-type differences. The project will also tag and assay multiple allelic versions of a small number of DAPs in which pathogenic or potentially pathogenic mutations have been identified. The project will produce genome-wide DAP maps and identify motifs for hundreds of human regulatory proteins, providing an important component for the next phase of the ENCODE Project. All data, as well as useful materials in the form of gene editing plasmids and tagged human cell lines, will be made freely available to the research community.",

        "description": "The overall mission of this Mapping Center is to create and disseminate open access, comprehensive, high-quality, high-resolution reference maps of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in the human and mouse genomes, at previously unattainable levels of cellular and anatomical definition. Regulatory DNA is actuated in an exceptionally state-specific manner;; accordingly, achieving a comprehensive map of DHSs necessitates the interrogation of an expansive and finely partitioned range of cell and tissue samples. Progressive technical improvements and recent innovations have resulted in dramatic (>100x) decreases in requisite input biological sample quantities coupled with equally dramatic (>100x) increases in assay throughput, and corresponding decreases in the incremental cost of generating reference-quality DHS maps. These advances have in turn opened the possibility of systematically addressing all well-defined physiologically and disease-relevant anatomic and cellular compartments. Four major Specific Aims are targeted: (1) To create open access, comprehensive high-quality, high- resolution reference maps of human DNase I hypersensitive sites; (2) To create and disseminate comprehensive high-quality, high-resolution reference maps of mouse DNase I hypersensitive sites; (3) To maintain and disseminate reference indices of DNase I hypersensitive sites and footprints in the human and mouse genomes; and (4) To enable large-scale intake of Consortium and Community samples for high-quality, high-throughput DHS mapping.",

The ENCODE Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via experimental assays with laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover how chromosomal elements function together to define human cells and tissues. The DCC's participation enhances the data created by these laboratories through the creation of structured procedures for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created the DCC will construct a state of the art data warehouse. The DCC will design and development robust software to enhance the data submission and unified data processing pipelines, the organization and access to metadata and the data warehouse. In addition, we will develop and maintain the ENCODE Portal that will be the primary entry point to the wealth of experimentally determined information as well as results of computational analyses. The Portal will integrate these data resources and make them available via enhanced search and browsing capabilities. Tools will be implemented to aid discovery by both experienced bioinformaticians and naïve laboratory staff. The DCC will evolve into a substantial service organization allowing biomedical research to take full advance of the ENCODE results. To this end the DCC will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations. The DCC, DAC, production laboratories and AWG will be tightly woven together to create the ENCODE Consortium.",

        "abstract": "The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.",

Additional in vivo genome-wide characterization of transcription factor binding patterns and high-resolution DNA methylation analyses are clearly required for stronger support of each model. AU"

        "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 x 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at  the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.",

Selecting  the most likely causal variants within an LD block is relatively straightforward  within coding sequence, but is more difficult when all variants are intergenic. Predicting functional non-coding sequence has been recently facilitated by the availability of conservation and epigenomic information. We present HaploReg, a tool for exploring annotations of the non-coding genome among the results of published GWAS or novel sets of variants. Using LD information from the 1000 Genomes Project, linked SNPs and small indels can be visualized along with their  predicted chromatin state in nine cell types, conservation across mammals and their effect on regulatory motifs. Sets of SNPs, such as those resulting from GWAS, are analyzed for an enrichment of cell type-specific enhancers. HaploReg will be useful to researchers developing mechanistic hypotheses of the impact of  non-coding variants on clinical phenotypes and normal variation.

BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF  features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as  pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

We report a proteome-wide, site-specific survey of ubiquitylation changes after ultraviolet irradiation, identifying numerous upregulated and downregulated ubiquitylation sites on known components of DNA-damage signalling, as well as on proteins not previously implicated in this process. Our results uncover a critical role for PCNA-associated factor PAF15 (p15(PAF)/KIAA0101) ubiquitylation during DNA replication. During unperturbed S phase, chromatin-associated PAF15 is modified by double mono-ubiquitylation of Lys 15 and 24 templated through PCNA binding. Replication blocks trigger rapid, proteasome-dependent removal of Lys 15/24-ubiquitylated PAF15 from PCNA, facilitating bypass of replication-fork-blocking lesions by allowing recruitment of translesion DNA synthesis polymerase polη to mono-ubiquitylated PCNA at stalled replisomes. Our findings demonstrate widespread involvement of ubiquitin signalling in genotoxic-stress responses and identify a critical function for dynamic PAF15 ubiquitylation in safeguarding genome integrity when DNA replication is challenged.",

We discuss how ChIP quality, assessed in these ways, affects different uses of ChIP-seq data.

We developed a genome-scale approach--Repli Seq--to map temporally ordered replicating DNA using massively parallel sequencing and applied it to study regional variation in human DNA replication time across multiple human cell types. The method requires as few as 8,000 cytometry-fractionated cells for a single analysis, and provides high-resolution DNA replication patterns with respect to both cell-cycle time and genomic position. We find that different cell types exhibit characteristic replication signatures that reveal striking plasticity in regional replication time patterns covering at least 50% of the human genome. We also identified autosomal regions with marked biphasic replication timing that include known regions of monoallelic expression as well as many previously uncharacterized domains. Comparison with high-resolution genome-wide profiles of DNaseI sensitivity revealed that DNA replication typically initiates within foci of accessible chromatin comprising clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites, and that replication time is better correlated with chromatin accessibility than with gene expression. The data collectively provide a unique, genome-wide picture of the epigenetic compartmentalization of the human genome and suggest that cell-lineage specification involves extensive reprogramming of replication timing patterns.",

We applied this approach to the ENm008 domain on human chromosome 16, containing the α-globin locus, which is expressed in K562 cells and silenced in lymphoblastoid cells (GM12878). The models accurately reproduce the known looping interactions between the α-globin genes and their distal regulatory elements. Further, we find using our approach that the domain folds into a single globular conformation in GM12878 cells, whereas two globules are formed in K562 cells. The central cores of these globules are enriched for transcribed genes, whereas nontranscribed chromatin is more peripheral. We propose that globule formation represents a higher-order folding state related to clustering of transcribed genes around shared transcription machineries, as previously observed by microscopy.",

In many cases regulatory elements can be located at distances up to several megabases from their target genes. Recent evidence shows that long-range control of gene expression can be mediated through direct physical interactions between genes and these regulatory elements. Such looping interactions can be detected using the chromosome conformation capture (3C) methodology. Although 3C is experimentally straightforward, to draw meaningful conclusions one must carefully design 3C experiments and implement the conscientious use of controls.

We also analyzed yeast chromosome III at the G1 stage of the cell cycle. We found that chromatin is highly flexible throughout. Furthermore, functionally distinct AT- and GC-rich domains were found to exhibit different conformations, and a population-average 3D model of chromosome III could be determined.

Interactions between genomic elements can be detected using the chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology. We recently developed a high-throughput adaptation of 3C, 3C-carbon copy (5C), that is used to measure networks of millions of chromatin interactions in parallel. As in 3C, cells are treated with formaldehyde to cross-link chromatin interactions. The chromatin is solubilized, digested with a restriction enzyme and ligated at low DNA concentration to promote intra-molecular ligation of cross-linked DNA fragments. Ligation products are subsequently purified to generate a 3C library. The 5C technology then employs highly multiplexed ligation-mediated amplification (LMA) to detect and amplify 3C ligation junctions. The resulting 5C library of ligated primers is analyzed using either microarray detection or ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing. The 5C protocol described here can be completed in 13 d.",

We validated 5C by detection of several previously identified looping interactions in the beta-globin locus. We also identified a new looping interaction in K562 cells between the beta-globin Locus Control Region and the gamma-beta-globin intergenic region.

        "abstract": "Disruptions in local chromatin structure often indicate features of biological interest such as regulatory regions. We find that sonication of cross-linked chromatin, when combined with a size-selection step and massively parallel short-read sequencing, can be used as a method (Sono-Seq) to map locations of high chromatin accessibility in promoter regions. Sono-Seq sites frequently correspond to actively transcribed promoter regions, as evidenced by their co-association with RNA Polymerase II ChIP regions, transcription start sites, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks, and CpG islands; signals over other sites, such as those bound by the CTCF insulator, are also observed. The pattern of breakage by Sono-Seq overlaps with, but is distinct from, that observed for FAIRE and DNase I hypersensitive sites. Our results demonstrate that Sono-Seq can be a useful and simple method by which to map many local alterations in chromatin structure. Furthermore, our results provide insights into the mapping of binding sites by using ChIP-Seq experiments and the value of reference samples that should be used in such experiments.",

        "abstract": "Recent progress in mapping transcription factor (TF) binding regions can largely be credited to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technologies. We compared strategies for mapping TF binding regions in mammalian cells using two different ChIP schemes: ChIP with DNA microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) and ChIP with DNA sequencing (ChIP-PET). We first investigated parameters central to obtaining robust ChIP-chip data sets by analyzing STAT1 targets in the ENCODE regions of the human genome, and then compared ChIP-chip to ChIP-PET. We devised methods for scoring and comparing results among various tiling arrays and examined parameters such as DNA microarray format, oligonucleotide length, hybridization conditions, and the use of competitor Cot-1 DNA. The best performance was achieved with high-density oligonucleotide arrays, oligonucleotides >/=50 bases (b), the presence of competitor Cot-1 DNA and hybridizations conducted in microfluidics stations. When target identification was evaluated as a function of array number, 80%-86% of targets were identified with three or more arrays. Comparison of ChIP-chip with ChIP-PET revealed strong agreement for the highest ranked targets with less overlap for the low ranked targets. With advantages and disadvantages unique to each approach, we found that ChIP-chip and ChIP-PET are frequently complementary in their relative abilities to detect STAT1 targets for the lower ranked targets; each method detected validated targets that were missed by the other method. The most comprehensive list of STAT1 binding regions is obtained by merging results from ChIP-chip and ChIP-sequencing. Overall, this study provides information for robust identification, scoring, and validation of TF targets using ChIP-based technologies.",

        "abstract": "We have mapped the chromosomal binding site distribution of a transcription factor in human cells. The NF-kappaB family of transcription factors plays an essential role in regulating the induction of genes involved in several physiological processes, including apoptosis, immunity, and inflammation. The binding sites of the NF-kappaB family member p65 were determined by using chromatin immunoprecipitation and a genomic microarray of human chromosome 22 DNA. Sites of binding were observed along the entire chromosome in both coding and noncoding regions, with an enrichment at the 5' end of genes. Strikingly, a significant proportion of binding was seen in intronic regions, demonstrating that transcription factor binding is not restricted to promoter regions. NF-kappaB binding was also found at genes whose expression was regulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha, a known inducer of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression, as well as adjacent to genes whose expression is not affected by tumor necrosis factor alpha. Many of these latter genes are either known to be activated by NF-kappaB under other conditions or are consistent with NF-kappaB's role in the immune and apoptotic responses. Our results suggest that binding is not restricted to promoter regions and that NF-kappaB binding occurs at a significant number of genes whose expression is not altered, thereby suggesting that binding alone is not sufficient for gene activation.",

Using two deeply sequenced data sets for human RNA polymerase II and STAT1, each with matching input-DNA controls, we describe a general scoring approach to address unique challenges in ChIP-seq data analysis. Our approach is based on the observation that sites of potential binding are strongly correlated with signal peaks in the control, likely revealing features of open chromatin. We develop a two-pass strategy called PeakSeq to compensate for this. A two-pass strategy compensates for signal caused by open chromatin, as revealed by inclusion of the controls. The first pass identifies putative binding sites and compensates for genomic variation in the 'mappability' of sequences. The second pass filters out sites not significantly enriched compared to the normalized control, computing precise enrichments and significances. Our scoring procedure enables us to optimize experimental design by estimating the depth of sequencing required for a desired level of coverage and demonstrating that more than two replicates provides only a marginal gain in information.",

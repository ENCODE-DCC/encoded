First, gene transcription needs to be accurately regulated and defects in gene regulation can result in human diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Second, chromosomes need to be replicated and then accurately and reliably transmitted to daughter cells. Chromosome segregation requires extensive chromosome compaction. Defects in this process can lead to genome instability, aneuploidy and cancer. Recent studies have revealed that the spatial organization of chromosomes is a major factor in controlling both gene expression and chromosome segregation. The work proposed here will for the first time characterize the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of chromosomes during different stages of the cell cycle at unprecedented resolution which will allow the identification of cis-elements involved in the 3D folding of chromosomes. A set of novel and powerful genomic technologies (5C and Hi-C) that allow the mapping of 3D chromosome folding will be applied to the study of the human genome. These technologies will be combined with the use of synchronous cell populations and genome-wide analysis of regulatory elements to characterize the different chromosome conformations during the cell cycle and to identify the cis-elements and some trans-factors involved. In addition, the processes that determine 3D folding of the genome, such as transcription and modulation of DNA topology will be studied. This project will provide answers to long-standing questions related to long-range gene regulation, chromosome segregation, the epigenetic transmission of transcription profiles to daughter cells, and the still largely mysterious process of formation of compact metaphase chromosomes."

Previous large-scale efforts have produced an excellent catalog of transcriptional start sites for most mammalian genes but the mechanisms that control the activation of each promoter in specific cell types remains largely Unknown. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of tissue- and cell type-specific gene expression, it is important to characterize the activities of each promoter in specific cell types, and identify the cis-regulatory elements including enhancers and insulators for each gene. Here, we propose to use the laboratory mouse as a model system and conduct genome-wide analysis of active promoters, enhancers and insulator elements in a panel of embryonic and adult tissues with medical relevance. Specifically, we will (1) identify the active promoters in the mouse genome in a representative set of embryonic and adult tissues; (2) identify potential enhancers and insulator elements in the mouse genome in the same embryonic and adult tissues; (3) identify and characterize tissue-specific promoters and enhancers in the mouse genome; and (4) validate the function of a select set of identified promoters and enhancers. The proposed study, if completed, will result in a comprehensive map of promoters, potential enhancers and insulators throughout the mouse genome. The resource will provide a foundation for analyzing the gene regulatory networks in the mouse cells, and guide the functional annotation of the mouse genome. The results will also help understand the evolution of cis-regulatory sequences, when compared to similar results to be made available as the human ENCODE project progresses. The laboratory mouse represents an important model system for understanding human biology and the molecular basis of human diseases. As a reference to the human genome, the mouse genome sequence has proved extremely valuable in gene annotation. The utility of the laboratory mouse as a model system is currently limited by the lack of understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms that control both common and species-specific gene expression programs in mouse cells. In this project, we propose to define the set of genomic sequences known as cis-regulatory elements in the mouse genome. These regulatory DNA consists of promoters, enhancers, insulators and other regulatory sequences. As a key step towards understanding the gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, we will produce a comprehensive map of promoters, enhancers and insulators in the mouse genome. We will use a newly developed, high throughput experimental strategy to identify these sequences that are engaged in gene activation in the mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic fibroblasts, and a panel of embryonic and adult tissues. We will identify tissue specific promoters and enhancers, and characterize the regulatory mechanisms that control the gene expression programs in the specific tissues. Completion of the proposed research is expected to improve our knowledge of the gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, and provide a reference for understanding the same process in human beings."

Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome."" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes. Individual susceptibility to disease is determined in part by genetics, and we can map with high precision the locations of DNA variants associated with disease susceptibility. In order to understand how these variants contribute to disease susceptibility, we need to identify the biological functions of all DNA sequences; the proposed work will help us map these functional DNA sequences."

The ENCODE project has focused its initial attention on two cell lines, 1) K562 cells, a myeloid precursor cell line and 2) GM12878, a lymphoblastoid cell line, and our laboratory has mapped the binding sites of a large number of transcription factor expressed in these cells. To study their conservation and help provide functional information into these binding sites and to determine if these sites are occupied in vivo, we propose two types of studies. First, we will map the binding sites of at least 30 transcription factor orthologs that have been analyzed in the human ENCODE project in mouse MEL and CH12 cells which are analogous to K562 and GM12878 cells, respectively. Second, we will map the binding sites of Pol II and nine other factors in cells differentiated from human CD34+ cells and primary erythroid mouse cells. These studies will determine which transcription factor binding sites and gene targets are conserved in vertebrates and which are species-specific as well as determine the extent to which targets mapped in cultured cell lines reflect in vivo binding sites. The information from these studies will be deposited into public databases and is expected to be extremely valuable to the large mouse and human genetic communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ENCODE project has produced relatively large amounts of data on transcription factor binding and RNA expression in a limited number of human cell lines. We propose to extend these results by obtaining mouse cell lines at similar states of differentiation to human cell lines. We will then duplicate the experiments that have been done in human cells, and locate control elements based on sequence conservation and similarities in factor binding between the two species. We will also determine if elements identified in vitro are occupied in cells isolated from organisms."

Digital DNaseI technology enables efficient genome-wide mapping of accessible chromatin and DNaseI hypersensitive sites. The core regions of DNaseI hypersensitive sites are constitutively populated by regulatory factor binding sites, the nucleotide-resolution footprints of which may be systematically exposed on a genome-wide scale by ultra-deep sequencing. DNaseI hypersensitive sites exhibit marked cell-type variability; accordingly, production of a comprehensive catalog will require surveying a wide range of cell types. Cell types targeted under this proposal include murine analogues of the ENCODE Tier 1 and Tier 2 common reference cell lines; a broad spectrum of primary adult tissues; embryonic stem cells; and sentinel tissues amenable to sequential temporal profiling during development. The production of a parallel, high-quality, high-resolution compendium of mouse regulatory DNA will greatly enhance the value of the human ENCODE project and will provide a rich independent and unique resource for evolutionary, functional, and model organism genomics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance to Public Health Understanding the genetic basis of human disease requires detailed knowledge of the functional elements of the human genome which may be subject to polymorphism. The ENCODE Project seeks to identify all of the functional elements in the human genome, and present project seeks to greatly increase the value of the ENCODE data by providing a parallel catalogue of regulatory DNA in the mouse genome. This project is therefore expected to provide key insights into the importance of elements in the human genome, and to provide an unprecedented resource for rational functional modeling of human disease in the mouse."

In pursuit of this goal, we have assembled a unique scientific team and infrastructure with broad expertise and capabilities in stem cell biology, epigenomics, technology, production research and computation. We recently demonstrated two complementary methods that leverage ultra high-throughput sequencing for epigenomic analysis. In the first method, genome-wide chromatin maps are acquired by deep sequencing chromatin IP DNA (ChlP-Seq). In the second, nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps are generated by high-throughput bisulfite-sequencing (HTBS). These methods represent major improvements over prior tools as they yield precise digital information, have high genome coverage, require fewer cells and are cost-effective. Multiple epigenomic maps have already been produced for stem cells and primary tissues, and pipelines have been assembled for efficient data collection, processing and analysis. For the REMC project, we propose to apply ChlP-Seq and HTBS pipelines to generate comprehensive high-resolution maps of chromatin state and DNA methylation for 100 diverse cell types. Cell types were selected for their biological and medical importance, and for their potential to maximize the comprehensiveness of acquired epigenomic data. They include human ES cells, ES-derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells, reprogrammed stem cells and primary tissues. ChlP-Seq will be used to map highly informative chromatin modifications and related chromatin proteins in each cell type. HTBS will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps. Reference epigenomes will reveal the locations and activation states of diverse functional genomic elements, inform on the developmental state and potential of studied cell populations, and provide a framework for understanding complex epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. All data will be made available to the scientific community upon verification. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive characterization of epigenetic marks ('the epigenome') is a critical step towards a global understanding of the human genome in health and disease. The proposed mapping studies will provide unprecedented views of the human epigenetic landscape and its variation across cell states, offer fundamental insight into the functions and interrelationships of epigenetic marks, and provide a framework for future studies of normal and diseased epigenomes."

The Center integrates this capacity with an existing high-throughput genomics and informatics infrastructure operating at scale, creating unique synergies that enable genome-scale epigenetic analyses of high-value human primary and progenitor cell types. The Center will perform high-resolution, whole-genome profiling of foundational epigenotypes in project cell types including high-resolution quantification of chromatin structural remodeling, and analysis of DNA methylation at both actively remodeled and silenced regulatory DNA templates. The Center will also profile both small RNA species and conventional gene expression from all study cell types.

In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps.

The UCSC browser is a robust, flexible platform that integrates a variety of features that make accessing genomic data both convenient and information-rich. As such, it has attained a high level of acceptance throughout the biology, bioinformatics, and biomedical research communities. During the pilot phase of the ENCODE project, involving 1% of the genome, UCSC has been the repository of sequence-based data. Through participation in the pilot phase, we have established cost-effective, high-throughput approaches for incorporating and displaying ENCODE data, and we have developed an effective interface to the consortium for uploading data files and methods documentation to our FTP site. Through ongoing expansion and improvement of our ENCODE browser, we have laid the groundwork for data management in the whole-genome phase of the project. UCSC's specific aims for participation as the ENCODE DCC are as follows: 1) coordinate closely with the ENCODE data providers to collect, store, and manage ENCODE sequence-based functional element data and related metadata; 2) provide and maintain a long-term storage system for data from the ENCODE Consortium and related genomic projects; 3) provide the ENCODE and public research communities with freely-available mechanisms to access, search, and analyze the ENCODE data; 4) employ good software engineering practices to ensure that the ENCODE data are of the highest possible quality; and 5) foster collaboration with the biomedical community. Fundamental to understanding human biology and disease is the ability to identify and locate the functional elements in the human genome sequence.

The DCC's participation enhances the data created by these laboratories through the creation of structured pipelines for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created by the previous ENCODE projects as well as data from the modENCODE project and any other large data collections that are determined to be appropriate for incorporation, the DCC will construct a state of the art data storage repository called the Big Data Hub. The DCC will design and development new software to enhance the data submission and processing pipeline, the organization and access to metadata and the Big Data Hub. In addition, we will create the ENCODE Portal that will be the primary entry point to the wealth of experimentally determined information as well as results of computational analyses. The Portal will integrate these data resources and make them available via enhanced search and browsing capabilities. Tools will be implemented to aid discovery by both experienced bioinformaticians and naive laboratory staff. The DCC will evolve into a substantial service organization allowing biomedical research to take full advance of the ENCODE results. To this end the DCC will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations.

These RNA samples will be analyzed using: a) high density tiling arrays (5 nucleotides [nt] interrogation resolution for long and short RNAs), b) sequencing (pyrosequencing [454] and clonal single molecule sequencing for short RNAs [Solexa]), c) sequenced paired-end ditags (PETs) for 5' TSS and 3' termination locations for polyA+ transcripts and d) sequenced cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) tags for 5' TSS of polyA- RNAs. Characterization of full length subcellular compartment-specific transcripts will also be carried out using: 1) a combination of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), RT-PCR and sequencing, 2) RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and 3) in situ immunohistochemistry. These characterization steps will provide additional information concerning the annotated and unannotated RNAs found to be associated with known functional, compartment-specific proteins and their localization in subcellular organelles of known function. The research and health-care community are well positioned to take advantage of a detailed catalog of classified transcribed regions in the human genome.

We will accomplish this goal by identifying regions of open chromatin with two independent and complementary methods: DNasel hypersensitivity and Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE), combined with single-nucleosome mapping and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for selected regulatory factors. The immediate benefit of success will be a high-quality public atlas of the human DNA regulatory elements that are likely to be active in each cell type. Identification of open chromatin regions has been one of the most accurate and robust methods to identify functional promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions in mammalian cells. A principal advantage of an open chromatin approach is that all potential sites in the genome are simultaneously assayed in an unbiased manner. DNasel hypersensitivity and FAIRE interrogate chromatin by entirely different underlying mechanisms, and therefore represent independent, cross-validating assessments of chromatin state. In addition, we will perform single-nucleosome mapping in selected cell types as an independent direct biochemical verification of open chromatin regions. For a selected subset of cell-types, we will further annotate open chromatin regions with respect to their biological activity by determining the binding location of proteins that mark transcription start sites, transcriptional units, insulators, or have broad regulatory function. The Aims of this proposal are 1) to identify all regions of open chromatin in 40 cell types by DNasel and FAIRE analyses, and 2) determine the biological function of open chromatin regions by ChIP and nucleosome mapping.

These experiences, together with the resulting technology and analysis platforms and an existing, highly productive infrastructure, lead to this response to NHGRI's RFA-HG-07-030. This application presents an ambitious proposal to expand a program to map and functionally annotate cis-regulatory sequences of the human genome. The plan emphasizes full genome-comprehensivity for three experimental pipelines.: 1) a new sequence-based method called ChlPSeq to elucidate more than 600 comprehensive transcription factor:DNA interactomes; 2) a similar new method called MethSeq to determine the methylation status of all the CpG-rich regions in the human genome in more than 1,000 human cell types and cell states; and 3) a high throughput transfection assay pipeline to measure transcriptional activities of 25,000 human ""promoter-plus"" proximal cis-regulatory domains, including at least one major promoter for each of the annotated protein-coding genes. A second major product of the promoter pipeline will be a physical resource of proximate reporter constructs for all human genes, designed to accommodate future fine-structure dissection of the promoter regulatory motifs and testing of long-distance elements. All of the experimental work in this project will be subjected to analysis with appropriate quality metrics. In addition, comparative genomics and other computational analyses will be integrated with the experimental production to help prioritize and shape input to the pipelines and to capture information in forms useful to both biologists and genomicists. These analyses will produce several large-scale deliverables, including hundreds of ChIP data-driven sequence motif models, some of which additionally leverage evolutionary conservation for each of hundreds of transcription factors."

We plan to map DNaseI hypersensitive sites at physiological resolution across the genome with high sensitivity and specificity. The major focus of our production effort will be on data quality, a strategy that served the Human Genome Project well. Accordingly, samples will be rigorously screened in a pipeline fashion, with only a select set advancing to whole-genome data collection (Specific Aim 1). To ensure the broadest possible coverage of both unique and non-unique genomic territories, a synergistic combination of three technologies (DNase-array, digital mapping of DNAasel cleave site sequences, and Quantitative Chromatin Profiling) will be applied (Specific Aim 2). This combination will enable mapping of >95% of the DHSs in the genome of each cell type. Independent validation provides the ultimate quality standard. We therefore plan to validate the DHS catalogue in a statistically rigorous fashion using hypersensitivity Southerns, a well-established, gold standard assay (Specific Aim 3). Since DNAasel hypersensitive sites are generic markers of a broad spectrum of human cis-regulatory sequences, the utility of the catalogue will be greatly enhanced by the classification of DHSs into major functional categories including promoters, distal elements (enhancers, LCRs), and insulators (Specific Aim 4). Validation of DHS functional classes will be accomplished using well-tested cell and transgenic assays of biological function (Specific Aim 5)."

Comprehensive identification and characterization of functional DNA elements is thus an essential goal with major implications for human health. Genomic DNA is organized into chromatin, a higher-order structure composed of DNA, RNA and proteins. Chromatin mapping technologies have emerged as a powerful means for identifying functional DNA elements, which are associated with characteristic chromatin structures. Mapping has enabled the systematic annotation of diverse types of functional elements, including promoters, enhancers and silencers, and new discoveries related to chromatin organization and genome regulation in health and disease. The proposed ENCODE data production center aims to vastly expand the catalog of functional elements in the human genome through production mapping of Protein, DNA and RNA constituents of chromatin. High-throughput pipelines will be used to map histone modifications, chromatin regulatory proteins and non-coding RNA binding interactions. These pipelines will be applied to designated ENCODE cell lines, embryonic stem (ES) cells and derivatives, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and phenotypically diverse human tissues. Key histone modifications will also be mapped in representative cell and tissue types from multiple individuals, in order to address the extent and significance of inter-individual variation in chromatin landscapes and their relationships to genetic background. These multi-dimensional datasets will be integrated through innovative computational algorithms to identify sequences, motifs, variants and regulatory interactions that dictate chromatin state and functional element activity. Thus, the proposed project will dramatically increase the number, resolution and precision of functional DNA elements in the ENCODE catalog, and explicitly define causal sequences and physical interactions that mediate chromatin states and regulation in the human genome. All data will be rapidly released and made freely available to the scientific community."

Sequence-specific and general transcription factors will be mapped across the genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChlP-Seq). Long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) will be mapped using ChlRP-seq, a method by which specific chromatin-bound RNAs and their associated regions are isolated using oligonucleotides followed by sequencing of the precipitated DNA. The results obtained from our genome wide mapping experiments will greatly advance the efforts of the ENCODE consortium to comprehensively identify all functional elements in the human genome. Our experimental data will be subjected to stringent quality metrics already established by the consortium and the results made publicly available in a timely manner. Targeted biological validation experiments will be performed, along with integrative analyses. All experiments and analyses will be performed by a highly experienced and well-integrated team of experts that has already established a successful working relationship.

This pertains in particular to gene regulatory elements, many of which are located far away from their target genes, but play fundamental roles in human biology. Significant progress towards annotation of the gene regulatory architecture has been made in recent years predominantly using cultured human cells. However, large-scale studies in mice, as well as anecdotal examples identified in human studies, have indicated the existence of large populations of gene regulatory sequences with very restricted temporal and tissue-specific activity during mammalian development. Despite their critical importance in human development and disease, this set of regulatory sequences will likely be missed by approaches restricted to cell lines or adult tissues. To fill this gap, the major objective for this U54 application is to generate catalogs of developmentally active gene regulatory sequences using existing high throughput data production pipelines for genomic approaches including ChlP-Seq, MethylC-Seq and RNA-Seq on embryonic tissues. Performing such studies directly on human tissues is not feasible due to limited availability of human embryos at relevant stages of development. We will therefore in this study exploit the laboratory mouse, a widely used animal model that shares a similar embryonic developmental program and gene regulatory architecture with humans. In addition to embryonic development, our studies will also generate a complementary reference dataset from postnatal and adult mice to better understand the dynamics of gene regulation over time. Furthermore, we will assess the biological authenticity of identified regulatory sequences by in-depth functional validation using an established transgenic mouse pipeline. It is anticipated that generation of these datasets will fill a major void in the functional annotation o a mammalian genome and help to complete the catalog of gene regulatory sequences in the human genome."

The combination of experiences from the previous phases with the resulting technology and analysis platforms and the existing, highly productive infrastructure of the applicants form the basis of this response to NHGRI's RFA-HG-11-024 (""Expanding the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) in the Human and Model Organisms""). This application presents an ambitious proposal to expand the biological dimensions of ENCODE to include essentially all transcription factors for measurements of occupancy and to produce transcriptomes from hundreds of very specific cell types, and even single cells. The specific plan is to: 1) determine genome wide occupancy for all transcription factors and major cofactors with high resolution in two or more cell types; 2) map and quantify all messenger RNA transcripts, microRNAs and other non-ribosomal RNAs in more than 300 well-defined, uncultured cell types; 3) map DNA methylation state genome-wide at nucleotide resolution in more than 300 cell types; and 4) apply a high-throughput transient transfection assay system to test the impact of -2,000 candidate regulatory elements on gene regulation. All experimental work in this project will be evaluated by appropriate quality metrics, and after quality control, all data will be rapidly deposited in publi, freely accessible genome databases. In addition, computational analyses, including evaluation of comparative and population genomics data, will be integrated with the experimental production to help ensure quality and to capture information in forms useful to biologists, genomicists, and medical researchers.

From each sample analyzed, we propose to isolate long (>200 nucleotides) and short (< 200 nucleotides) RNA in biological duplicate. Illumina-based maps for these samples will initially be generated using (1) RNA sequencing (-seq) of ribosomal (r-)RNA depleted long total RNA. (2) RNA-seq of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) pre-treated short RNA (3) Pair-end Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (PE-CAGE) of total RNA. Additionally, for a subset of primary cell lines we will generate the above libraries from nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular fractions. Long RNA-Seq data will be distilled down into functional elements consisting of splice junctions, polyadenylatio sites and de novo genes and transcripts. The short RNA data will be distilled into contigs representing the 5' ends of short RNAs up to the read length. PE-CAGE data will be analyzed to form clusters representing the 5' ends of transcripts linked to a tag internal to the transcript body. Importantly, each element will be assessed for reproducibility using a nonparametric Irreproducible Detection Rate (nplDR) script. Collectively, these data will allow for the detection of novel transcribed regions and supportive information as to the location of promoter regions and subcellular residence of transcripts. In aggregate, these data will be used to generate models of both noncoding and protein coding transcripts and to distinguish isoforms at complex loci necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of mammalian transcriptomes. For a subset of these samples we will simultaneously collect the genome sequence of the human donors to provide a reference map that will be used to map the RNA data against and derive information concerning allele-specific expression and RNA editing. Unannotated transcript models will be tested using long-range (PacBio/454) sequencing. Lastly, proteogenomic analysis will be done and the results compared against the unannotated transcripts."

To do this, we will generate stable HeLa-S3 and GM 12878 cell lines expressing epitope-tagged RBPs and determine the sub cellular localization pattern of each RBP. These cells will be used to perform CLIP-Seq assays to define genome-wide, and at single-nucleotide resolution, the RNA sequence elements recognized by 250 RBPs. The RNA sequence elements identified will be validated using sequence-based in vitro binding assays. Furthermore, ChlP-Seq will be performed for all nuclear localized RBPs to determine the regions of the genome and chromatin that each RBP associates with. These binding assays will be supplemented with functional assays in RBP-depleted cells that will be critical for assigning functions to the identified binding sites. These assays include RNA-Seq of total cellular RNA and RNA purified from various cellular fractions, ribosomal footprint profiling, and Gro-Seq. Together, these assays will provide functional information regarding the roles of each RBP in splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, RNA stability, RNA editing, translation, RNA localization, and transcription. Bioinformatic analysis will be performed, largely using software generated by our group, to quantitate all assays and to associate functions to the sequence elements identified in the binding assays. Together, these experiments will provide a comprehensive and in depth measure of the functions of approximately half of the human RBPs and the functional sequence elements that they interact with. This project will fill a major gap in the catalog of functional elements encoded in the human genome that are being characterized by the ENCODE consortium. The product of this project will be a unique and valuable community resource that will push the field forward in new and exciting ways and will almost certainly create new paradigms regarding the functions of RBPs and RNA-protein networks in human biology and disease."

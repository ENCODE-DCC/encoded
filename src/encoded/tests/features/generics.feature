Feature: Generics

    Scenario Outline: Generics
        When I visit "/<type_name>/"
        And I wait for the content to load
        Then I should see an element with the css selector ".collection-charts"
        And I should see an element with the css selector ".collection-charts > .collection-charts__chart > .collection-charts__legend"
        And I should not see "No facets defined"

        When I click the link with text that contains "<link_text>"
        Then I should see an element with the css selector ".result-table"
        And I should not see "No results found"

        When I go back
        Then I should see an element with the css selector ".collection-charts"

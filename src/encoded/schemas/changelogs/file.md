## Changelog for file.json

### Schema version 12

* *run_type* and *mapped_run_type* were limited to only "single-ended" and "paired-ended" types

### Schema version 11

* *alternate_accessions* now must match accession format, "ENCFF..." or "TSTFF..."
* *no_file_available* field was added. The DCC will post this boolean field. Files with no_files_available = true will not be required to specify md5sum and file_size values.
* *revoke_detail* was added.  The DCC will post this field. The goal is to mkae the reason for file revoke clear.:

        "revoke_detail": {
            "title": "Revoke error detail",
            "description": "Explanation of why the file was revoked.",
            "comment": "Do not submit. The field would be posted by DCC.",
            "type": "string",
            "permission": "import_items"
        }
#### Formats and enums are more restrictive for several fields:

* *output_type* values ["predicted forebrain enhancers", "predicted heart enhancers", "predicted whole brain enhancers", "sequence alignability",] added to the list of values that could be submitted only by DCC personnel
* *revoke_detail* is available only for files with status = revoked

### Schema version 10

* *aliases* now must be properly namespaced according lab.name:alphanumeric characters with no leading or trailing spaces
* unsafe characters such as " # @ % ^ & | ~ ; ` [ ] { } and consecutive whitespaces will no longer be allowed in the alias

### Schema version 9.a

#### Fields restricted to DCC access only:
* *status*
* *restricted*
* *content_md5sum*
* *mapped_read_length*
* *mapped_run_type*

#### Fields that are now required for certain cases:

* *platform* value is now required for files with *file_format* that is one of ["fastq", "rcc", "csfasta", "csqual", "sra", "CEL", "idat"]
* *assembly* value is required for files with *file_format* that is one of ["bam", "sam", "gtf", "bigWig"]
* *file_size* value is now required for files with *status* that is one of ["in progress", "released", "archived", "revoked"]
* *paired_end* value (1, 2, or 1,2) is required for files with *run_type* = paired-ended and forbidden for run_type that is one of ["single-ended", "unknown"]
* *read_length* value is now required for files with *output_type* = reads and *file_format* that is one of ["fastq", "fasta", "csfasta", "csqual", "sra"]

#### Formats and enums are more restrictive for several fields:

* *date_created* format is limited now to only *date-time* and not one of ["date", "date-time"] as it used to be
* *md5sum* value formatting is now enforced with regex, validating it as a 32-character hexadecimal number
* *output_type* values ["tRNA reference", "miRNA reference", "snRNA reference"] added to the ist of values that could be submitted only by DCC personnel
* *file_format* values ["sra", "btr"] could be submitted only by DCC personnel

#### Restrictions for use were also put in place:

* *mapped_read_length* is available only for files with file_format = bam
* *mapped_run_type* is available only for files with file_format = bam
* *statuses* "uploaded" and "format check failed" were removed
* *paired_end* enums list was expanded to include a "1,2" value that is acceptable only for *file_format* = sra files that have *run_type* = paired_ended

### Schema version 9

* property *supercedes* was renamed to *supersedes*
* *assembly* values are no longer accepted for *file_format* = fastq

### Schema version 8

* *technical_replicates* was added as a calculated field.

* *mapped_read_length* was added for alignments when the length of the mapped reads differs from the accessioned fastq.

### Schema version 7

#### The following arrays were restricted to contain unique values

* *derived_from*
* *controlled_by*
* *supersedes*
* *aliases*
* *file_format_specifications*

### Schema version 6

* *output_type* was updated to have more accurate terms:

        "mapping": {
            'minus strand signal of multi-mapped reads': 'minus strand signal of all reads',
            'plus strand signal of multi-mapped reads': 'plus strand signal of all reads',
            'signal of multi-mapped reads': 'signal of all reads',
            'normalized signal of multi-mapped reads': 'normalized signal of all reads'
        }
       
### Schema version 5

* *run_type* was migrated from replicate.paired_ended. It will be required for fastq files.  If run_type is paired-ended then "paired_with" will be required as well.:

           "run_type": {
            "title": "Run type for sequencing files",
            "description": "Indicates if file is part of a single or paired run",

                "paired-ended",
                "unknown"
            ]
        },

* *read_length* was migrated this field from replicate.read_length.  It will be required for fastq files.:

            "read_length": {
                "title": "Read length",
                "description": "For high-throughput sequencing, the number of contiguous nucleotides determined by sequencing.",
                "type": "integer"
            },

* *read_length_units* was added as a calculated field.  It will not need to be submitted.

* *platform* was migrated this field from replicate.read_length.  It will be required for fastq files.:

            "platform": {
                "title": "Platform",
                "description": "The measurement device used to collect data.",

                "linkTo": "platform"
            },

                'narrowPeak': 'bigBed',
                'gappedPeak': 'bigBed',
                'bedRnaElements': 'bigBed'
            }

            "current_enum": [
                    "bam",
                    "bed",

                "bedRnaElements"
            ]

* *file_format_specifications* was added as a way to add description or autosql to the file object:

            "file_format_specifications": {
                "title": "File format specifications documents",
                "description": "Text or .as files the further explain the file format",
                "type": "array",

                        }
            },
             
* *output_category* added as a calculated field.  The files are now given one of these categories.:

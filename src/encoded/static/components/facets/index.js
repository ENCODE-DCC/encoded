/**
 * FACET REGISTRY API
 *
 * Each facet in a search-results object has a unique "field" value indicating the type of data the
 * facet contains. The facet registry lets you create custom React components to render various
 * parts of facets for a specific facet identified by its "field" value.
 *
 * You can register up to four types of components for any specific facet. The facet component
 * types are:
 *
 * Facet -- Render a complete facet, not including its title. This doesnâ€™t have to resemble a
 * "normal" facet at all; it could include its own menus, buttons, drop-downs, etc., and can keep
 * its own React states. It receives the following properties:
 *
 *   facet - Relevant `facet` object from `facets` array in `results`.
 *
 *   results - Complete search-results object for the entire page. This can be the object for a
 *   search-results object, report object, matrix object, etc.
 *
 *   mode (optional) - Indicates any special display modes, e.g. "picker".
 *
 *   relevantFilters - Filters selected by the user corresponding to the facet given in the
 *   `facet` property.
 *
 *   pathname - Search results path without query-string portion, e.g. "/search/" or "/matrix/".
 *
 *   queryString (optional) - Query-string portion of current URL without initial question mark,
 *   e.g. "type=Experiment&status=released".
 *
 *   onFilter (optional) - Special term click handler, used for facets on edit forms.
 *
 *   allowNegation (optional) - Allow facet terms to have negation controls. Defaults to true.
 *
 *   Registration method:
 *   FacetRegistry.Facet.register(<facet field>, <React component to render this facet>);
 *
 *
 * Title -- Render the title of a facet. By default, these appear in <h5> tags, but you can do
 * anything you want here. It receives the following properties:
 *
 *   facet - Relevant `facet` object from `facets` array in `results`.
 *
 *   results - Complete search-results object for the entire page. This can be the object for a
 *   search-results object, report object, matrix object, etc.
 *
 *   mode (optional) - Indicates any special display modes, e.g. "picker".
 *
 *   pathname - Search results path without query-string portion, e.g. "/search/" or "/matrix/".
 *
 *   queryString (optional) - Query-string portion of current URL without initial question mark,
 *   e.g. "type=Experiment&status=released".
 *
 *   Registration method:
 *   FacetRegistry.Title.register(<facet field>, <React component to render this title>);
 *
 *
 * Term -- Render each term of a facet. This lets you control the display of an entire term, how
 * (and whether) it links to other searches, and any other elements of a facet term you need. The
 * component you register gets called once for each term of the facet of a specific "field" value
 * you've attached it to. If you have a custom Facet component registered, it would most likely
 * render its own terms in its own way, and you would not typically use this Term registry for that
 * case. It receives the following properties:
 *
 *   term - Relevant term object within the facet object this component has registered for.
 *
 *   facet - Relevant `facet` object from `facets` array in `results`.
 *
 *   results - Complete search-results object for the entire page. This can be the object for a
 *   search-results object, report object, matrix object, etc.
 *
 *   mode (optional) - Indicates any special display modes, e.g. "picker".
 *
 *   pathname - Search results path without query-string portion, e.g. "/search/" or "/matrix/".
 *
 *   queryString (optional)- Query-string portion of current URL without initial question mark,
 *   e.g. "type=Experiment&status=released".
 *
 *   onFilter (optional) - Special term click handler, used for facets on edit forms.
 *
 *   allowNegation (optional) - Allow facet terms to have negation controls. Defaults to true.
 *
 *   Registration method:
 *   FacetRegistry.Term.register(<facet field>, <React component to render this term>);
 *
 *
 * TermName -- Render the text within a term. This registry exists for when you want to alter the
 * styling of the text of a term without changing anything else about how the term works. The
 * component you register gets called once for each term of the facet of a specific "field" value
 * you've attached it to. If you have custom Facet or Term components registered for this facet
 * field value, they would most likely render their own term titles in their own ways, and you
 * would not typically use this TermName registry for that case. Custom TermName components receive
 * the following properties:
 *
 *   term - Relevant term object within the facet object this component has registered for. The
 *   text of the term is in `term.key` and might have the "string" or "number" type.
 *
 *   Registration method:
 *   FacetRegistry.TermName.register(<facet field>, <React component to render this term name>);
 *
 *
 * SelectedTermName -- Render the text within the "Selected filters" links. This registry exists
 * for when you need to change the styling of the terms that can be cleared from the facet, or if
 * you have a mapping of actual facet term value to displayed term within "Selected filters."
 * Custom SelectedTermName components receive the folling properties:
 *
 *   filter - facets.filters object that is offered to the user for clearing. filter.term holds the
 *   name for the clear link.
 *
 *   Registration method:
 *   FacetRegistry.SelectedTermName.register(<facet field>
 *                                           <React component to render this selected term>);
 *
 *
 * Organization
 * Generally, each type of facet should be implemented in its own file and included above. However,
 * if all a custom facet does is call something in defaults.js, then that can go into a file shared
 * by all facets that only call that same default facet. For example, all facets that simply render
 * a basic "exists" facet should all share one file. If a facet calls a default facet renderer but
 * alters it in some way (e.g. the facet might appear only under certain conditions), then it might
 * be best put that custom facet and its registration into its own file.

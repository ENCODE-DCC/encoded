Organization deployment configuration and build files
=====================================================
    When `deploy` is run user_data is sent to AWS.  The user_data defines the type of deployment,
    i.e. Demo, es cluster, frontend, etc.  The user_data is compiled in two stages.  The first 
    stage creates an Assembled Template.  By default the template is in memory but a `deploy`
    argument exists that allows the assembled template to be saved and used later.  The second stage 
    adds Run Variables to the Assembled Template.  Then it can be sent as user_data to AWS to create
    an instance.

# Summary of cloud-config directory structure

#### Templates are assembled with ./template-parts
    # Standard Templates
    Demo/QA Demo                : app-es-pg-template.yml
    Cluster Frontend            : app-pg-template.yml
    Cluster Elasticsearch       : es-nodes-template.yml
    
    # Non Standard Templates
    Instance with remote pg     : app-es-template.yml
    Instance with remote pg/es  : app-template.yml

    Open one of the templates above to compare with ./template-parts.  Each variable '%(varname)s' 
    in the template has a matching file in ./template-parts.  Next is a way to view and save
    assembled templates.

    We can save Assembled Templates with the --save-configure `deploy` argument.  It will
    automaticallly determine which template to used based on input arguments.

    $ deploy --save-config-name 20200430

    ### Output
    Created assembeled template
           ./cloud-config/assembled-templates/20200430-app-es-pg.yml
    Deploy with
           $ deploy --use-prebuilt-config 20200430-app-es-pg
    Diff with on the fly assembly.  Does not deploy
           $ deploy --use-prebuilt-config 20200430-app-es-pg --diff-configs
    ###


#### Directories:
    template-parts              : Pieces of the templates
    run-scripts                 : Install scripts runcmd_* template parts
    configs                     : Configuration files used in run-scripts, like apache, java, es
    assembled-templates         : Saved.  These still contains Run Varialbes

#### Helper Script
    create-ami.py               : Create amis from deployed --ami-build in AWS

#### Run_Variables
    * Run variables are in /etc/environment file on the instance.  
    * They are used in the run-scripts to configure the system and application builds
    * /etc/environment is loaded into login/ssh sessions so you can echo them on the instance.
    * The file will contain dupicate entries when deploying from an AMI.  Last ones are used.
    
    View them locally with --dry-run along with other info.  Does not deploy
    $ deploy --dry-run

    Add options like --test, --release-candidate, or --candidate to see the differences in run vars.
    The ROLE should change along with other variables like ENCD_INDEX_PRIMARY, ENCD_INDEX_VIS,
    ENCD_INDEX_REGION.  The env vars are prefixed with ENCD_ as to not conflict with other env vars.
